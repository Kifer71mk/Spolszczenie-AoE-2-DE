35928 "Joan of Arc:\nIt is a war that has lasted for one hundred years, and the French have lost nearly every battle. Soon the English and their allies in Burgundy will conquer all of France. The heir to the French monarchy is too cowardly to ascend to the throne. The French army is wounded and tired and has given up all hope. But in the darkest hour, a young peasant girl declares that she intends to save France."
35958 "Saladin:\nOutraged that the Holy Land is ruled by Saracens, knights from Europe have descended upon the Middle East in a series of Crusades. Now four European kingdoms have sprung up in the desert. The Saracen king, Saladin, rallies his troops in an attempt to drive back the invaders. In response to European Crusades, the Saracens have organized a Jihad. In response to European vileness, the once-cultured Saracens have become treacherous. But will it be enough to save their homeland?"
35988 "Genghis Khan:\nThe nomadic tribes of the Asian steppes spent centuries entangled in their own petty feuds until united under Genghis Khan. Within years, a highly disciplined army pours out of Mongolia to embark on a campaign of world conquest. But how can a tribe of horse archers possibly overcome the military might of Persia and Eastern Europe, let alone the technologically advanced empires in China?"
36018 "Barbarossa:\nCan the will of one man forge an empire? Frederick Barbarossa attempts to force the squabbling German fiefdoms into his Holy Roman Empire, which he then must defend from the machinations of the Italian city states and the pope in Rome. And should he accomplish all of those feats, there is always the Third Crusade to wage."

Take command of the highlanders, and learn the basic concepts of Age of Empires II: Definitive Edition, such as how to build an economy, how to train your soldiers and, most importantly, how to fight and defeat your enemy. If you are new to real-time strategy games, you will learn all you need to know. If you have played the original Age of Empires, then you can skip ahead to new features, such as garrisoning and formations."

36167 "Experienced Age of Empires players may start with Scenario 6 - Forge an Alliance"
36228 "Attila the Hun:\nBarbarian hordes feast on the dying Roman empire. The most dangerous of these invaders are the Huns and their ferocious king, Attila. After pouring out of the Caspian steppes, looting and burning all the while, the Huns become so powerful that the Roman Empire is forced to pay a tribute to Attila. But the king of the Huns is still not satisfied, and he mobilizes his horsemen to invade Gaul and eventually Rome itself! Can nothing stop the brutal Attila?"
36258 "El Cid:\nSpain is divided between Christian kingdoms to the north and Moorish kingdoms to the south. In the barren borderlands of Castille, Rodrigo Díaz, called El Cid, gains notoriety as a brilliant general and heroic crusader. The Cid is so popular among soldiers and peasants alike that the distrustful King of Castille sends him into exile. The Cid must join forces with his former enemies, the Moors, and fight against his beloved Castille. But an even greater threat waits across the sea in Africa, where fanatical Berber horsemen are eager to seize what the Moors could not."
36288 "Montezuma:\nCenturies of conquest have allowed the Aztecs to become the mightiest empire in Central America. But when strangers appear on the shores of the Caribbean Sea, Montezuma, emperor of the Aztecs, is unsure whether they are conquerors...or gods. Can a vast empire of warriors using obsidian spears and cotton armor hold off mounted invaders armed with metal armor and gunpowder? Will the Aztec island-city of Tenochtitlan continue to conquer the Americas, or will it crumble beneath these foreign conquerors?"
36318 "The Conquerors:\nCertain names ring down through history as men and women who shaped the world. Some were forces of chaos, destructive and rapacious. Some were men of honor who fought for the right. Some defended their homelands from invaders, while others used their military might to violently acquire the lands of others. Battles such as Agincourt, Manzikert, and Hastings are remembered as turning points in world history, and names such as Henry V, Yi Sun-shin, and Erik the Red are etched forever as great conquerors. Now relive their tragedies and triumphs. "
36428 "Alaric:\nThe trauma of the Hun invasion in the 4th century has shaped Alaric, the fearsome warrior king of the Goths. Fleeing his ravaged homeland as a child, Alaric spent the rest of his life searching for a new place to call home. Can the beloved king secure a new homeland for his people in the territory of the collapsing Roman Empire?"
36458 "Dracula:\nHistory forged an incredible legend around the man who ruled Wallachia in the mid-15th century. Holding his ground against the vast armies of the expanding Ottoman Empire, his cruel tactics made him the most feared man in all of Eastern Europe. Shall his thirst for blood and the loyalty of his soldiers be enough to hold the Turks back for good?"
36488 "Bari:\n400 years after the collapse of the Roman empire, Italy is still up for grabs. In the deep south, Byzantines, Goths, Normans and Muslims all vie for control of the port city of Bari. Relive the tale of the city from the point of view of a Byzantine family, rising from the common soldiery to the nobility. But beware, for not only Bari is at stake, but also control of Southern Italy."
36518 "Sforza:\nAfter witnessing the death of his father, the young captain did not hesitate to take over command of his father's Condottieri. Always hungry for glory and wealth, Sforza wanders around 15th century Italy, offering his services to the highest bidder. Will he pick the right battles or make the wrong enemy? Take the fate of the young mercenary captain in your hands."
36548 "El Dorado:\nJoin Francisco Orellana and Gonzalo Pizarro on their quest to find El Dorado, the legendary Lost City of Gold, thought to be hidden somewhere in the vast Amazon rain forest. Will their quest along the Amazon river lead to lifelong prosperity or will they drown in their sorrow?"
36578 "Prithviraj:\nAs the 12th century comes to a close, India is divided between the ruling Rajput clans. One of them, the Chauhans, have just been blessed with a new king. His name is Prithviraj and his determination to unite the rival states is unprecedented. But what happens when he falls in love with the daughter of his enemy? And does he have the strength to stop a full-scale Muslim invasion from the west?"
36608 "Battles of the Forgotten:\nTime has faded the names of many of the greatest leaders ever known. During their age they were famed for their fierceness on the battlefield, their just rule and their quest for power. Witness the path to glory of Richard the Lionheart, Minamoto no Yoritomo, Sultan Osman Ghazi, Khosrau and many more."

44310	"You are going to need to research some technologies of your own to increase the strength of your civilization."
44311	"For example, researching Loom makes your villagers harder to kill. To research Loom, click the Town Center, then click the Research Loom button."

44314	"Now you have enough food to advance to the Feudal Age. However, you also need two buildings from your current age."

44409	"Your scouts report:\n\n- The Scots (Blue) have come to the village of Stirling to face the English in battle.\n\n- Across the stone bridge to the west lies the English fort (Red)."
44410	"The time has come to take the offensive. The English have a fort near the town of Stirling. If we can defeat the English here, they may think twice about their invasion of Scotland."
44411	"Build a Barracks and 5 Militia to defend your villagers and explore the map."
44412	"Before we attack the English to the west, we need to build up our forces. Have your villagers start gathering food and wood."
44413	"Keep making villagers at your Town Center until you have 10. The more villagers you have, the faster your resources will come in."
44414	"You can gain more food by building Fishing Ships. To create Fishing Ships, have your villagers build a Dock in the water to the south."
44415	"Now click the Dock, and build a Fishing Ship."
44416	"To fish, click a Fishing Ship and RIGHT-click on a leaping fish. The Fishing Ship will collect fish and automatically return them to the Dock. Fishing Ships are also useful for exploring."
44417	"Scout Cavalry are poor fighters but they can see a great distance. You can use your Scout Cavalry to explore the rest of the map and find the English."
44418	"The hill with the dead tree protects the only access to your town. It would be a good idea to build a Watch Tower on this hill once you advance to the Feudal Age."
44419	"An English Outpost! You know what to do ... knock it down!"
44420	"You are close to the English base. Better not knock down this wall until you have an army of about 12 soldiers."
44421	"Now you have a large enough force to attack the English base. Charge! Keep your villagers working just in case you suffer casualties and need to make more troops."
44422	"Great job! You have destroyed the English camp. The Battle of Stirling is sure to end in victory for the Scots!"
44423	"Now that you have reached the Feudal Age, concentrate on making some soldiers to fight the enemy. You will need at least 12."
44424	"The English are coming to attack! To protect your villagers, you can use the town bell to garrison them in your Town Center. Click your Town Center, then click Town Bell."
44425	"Good! You defeated the English assault. If you have villagers in your Town Center, ring the town bell again to send them back to work."
44426	"Good! Your Watch Tower will fire on enemy units and help protect your town."
44427	"You have found some sheep! Sheep are a good source of food, so send them back to your Town Center and assign a villager to gather food from them."
44428	"Now that you know how to build up, advance through the ages, and find and fight your enemies, you have all the basic skills you need to play a Random Map game, the most common type of game in Age of Empires II."
44429	"To win, destroy the English tower to the west."
44430	"Use your villagers to build a Mill near your forage bushes."
44431	"Once you have gathered 500 food, advance to the Feudal Age at your Town Center. If you are low on food, build some additional Farms."
44432	"Remember to upgrade weapons and armor at the Blacksmith. You do have a Blacksmith, don't you?"
44433	"Villagers can also build Farms. Build 4 Farms near your Mill when your forage bushes are depleted. Each Farm needs only one villager working on it."
44434	"Remember, you can upgrade your Militia to Men-at-Arms at the Barracks. You should always upgrade soldiers when you can afford it."
44435	"Don't forget, keep exploring the map."
44436	"Good job! You have eliminated the English soldiers. Now destroy that tower and our victory will be complete!"
44437	"You can specify a location for new units to gather by setting a gather point. For villagers, click the Town Center and click the Set Gather Point button."

Chalons (Green), Troyes (Orange) and Rheims (Yellow), the three towns occupied by the English, are across the river and are well defended.\n\n- The English at Chalons will field Knights and Scorpions, and even warships if threatened. Their town is unprotected and can be easily reached by crossing the shallows.\n\n- Troyes is slightly better defended, with walls and a Castle protecting the river crossing to the east. However, they are not prepared for an attack from the flank. They will train Pikemen and Knights to fight the French, but will also build warships if they feel that they are about to lose control of the river.\n\n- Rheims is a walled city protected by Castles and towers.

If you wish to convert enemy buildings, you will need to research Redemption first (in the Monastery).\n\n4. The sea can be an important battlefield and a good source of food. Including a navy in your strategy may prove useful."
61009	"Your scouts report:\n\n- El Cid's forces (Red) are allied with those of King Alfonso (Blue).\n\n- There are three enemies, the Black Guard Army (Cyan), the Black Guard Navy (Yellow) and Yusuf's Elite Guard (Green). The two land armies field mostly camelry and siege units. The navy trains War Galleys and Pikemen. All three of your enemies have walled cities with many towers, so try using Trebuchets and garrisoned Battering Rams against them. Eventually, you may need to build a navy as well. You can construct your Docks within the city of a vanquished enemy or in the no man's land between the cities."

Count Berenguer's army is mighty, but he does not own a navy. Therefore, you can get plenty of food from the Mediterranean, but fielding your own navy is not necessary.

None of these towns can field a large military.\n\n- El Cid's enemy is once again Count Berenguer (Purple). Berenguer has a well-fortified city in the north that will prove very difficult to siege. As such, other avenues to victory are a better option. Berengeur relies on combined arms of archery units, infantry, and Knights along with a plethora of siege weapons. Construct your defenses well!"

By placing your Huskarls right beneath a Town Center, you can rapidly destroy it.\n\n3. Huskarls are excellent at destroying buildings and fortifications, but they are no match against Cataphracts. Consider training different types of units as well when facing the main Roman force."
63109	"Your scouts report:\n\n- The Visigoths (Green) are far from home and do not have villagers or resources to construct a base. There are, however, several locations where new soldiers can be recruited.\n\n- Additional resources and buildings can be obtained by sacking the four Greek cities: Sparta, Argos, Corinth, and Athens.\n\n- Sparta (Red) lies south of your starting position. Its defense force of Knights, Pikemen, and Long Swordmen and should be relatively easy to master. Its main economic activity is woodcutting.\n\n- To the east is Argos (Yellow). A force of Light Cavalry, Elite Skirmishers, and Scorpions protects its walls. Because of its access to the sea, it has a steady food income.\n\n- Corinth (Blue) lies on the isthmus between the Peloponnese and the rest of Greece, which makes it of important strategic value. It fields Knights and Crossbowmen. Although it produces mostly wood, it is also known to be an important trade center. Securing that trade will generate gold for the Visigoths.\n\n- The famed city of Athens (Cyan) lies to the northeast of your camp, beyond Corinth, and cannot be reached initially. It is defended by Light Cavalry and Long Swordsmen. It is said that there is an important silver mine to the north of it. Although it does not generate as much as it once did, seizing it will incur additional gold tribute from the Athenians.\n\n- Eastern Roman defense forces (Purple) are scattered about Greece to protect it from barbarian raids. However, their main army is coming in from the northwest with the aim to end all raiding. It will train Knights, Long Swordsmen, Monks, and, most dangerous of all, Cataphracts."

The best way to obtain additional gold is to take the cities of Gaul.\n\n3. The Romans are still recovering from the sack of Rome, but even now they remain a formidable power.\n\n4. Rumor has it that Sarus is here in Gaul as well. Although it is not critical, it may be a good idea to get rid of this traitor once and for all.\n\n5. The enemy will try to overrun your position early on, so you need to prepare your defenses quickly. After the situation has stabilized, make use of the Goths' strengths to quickly mass a huge infantry army and overwhelm your enemies with your superior numbers."
63409	"Your scouts report:\n\n- The Western Roman Army (Blue) is reeling from its defeats in Italy, but it still has a large army in Iberia where it was sent to deal with the Vandal and Suebi invaders. Now that Rome has been sacked, it may return to Gaul. It consists of Cataphracts, swordsmen, and Halberdiers. \n\n- The city of Narbo (Red), one of your targets, lies to the south near the Mediterranean Sea. It will field Arbalesters, Light Cavalry, and rams.\n\n- To the north is the city of Valentia (Yellow). It will field infantry and heavy cavalry.\n\n- The last of the three Gallic cities, which the Romans call Tolosa (Cyan), lies to the far west. Tolosa is one of the strongest of the enemy cities, as it trains Paladins, Throwing Axemen, Monks, and Trebuchets. \n\n- Finally, Sarus (Purple) is familiar with the Visigoth tactics and will try to match our large infantry armies with his own. It is unlikely, that his soldiers will continue fighting once he is dead, however, so slaying him should be a priority."

The strongest Ottoman citadel is Darstor. It is well fortified and has a strong garrison. Several nearby Bulgarian and Wallachian towns provide it with supplies, so it would be wise to attack these towns first to weaken Darstor's garrison."
63709	"Your scouts report:\n\n- Dracula's army (Red) has arrived on the road northwest of Giurgiu after ambushing a Turkish regiment and is poised to raid the Danube region and northern Bulgaria. The city of Giurgiu (Purple) is well fortified but has few defenders, so if the Wallachians can acquire siege equipment it should be easy to take the city and use it as a base from which to raid the region. \n\n- Across the Danube River from Giurgiu lies the fortress of Darstor (Grey). It is occupied by the Turks, who have a strong military presence there. Expect to face Janissaries, Heavy Camels, Hussars, Bombard Cannons, Galleons and Cannon Galleons.\n\n- To the west, on the Wallachian side of the Danube, Orsova (Yellow) supplies timber to the nearby Turkish troops and to the local towns for shipbuilding. They have a highly mobile army consisting of Magyar Huszars, Cavalry Archers, and Knights.\n\n- East of Giurgiu, Obluciza (Green) is mining the rich stone deposits north of their city. This stone is used by the local towns to fortify themselves against Vlad's raids. Their Boyars, Archers, and Monks will not be easy to deal with.\n\n- Across the river, in northern Bulgaria, the village of Novoselo (Orange) is known for its fertile farmland. This food is sent directly to the Turkish garrisons. Only defended by Skirmishers and Light Cavalry, Novoselo is a rather easy target.\n\n- West of Darstor lies the Bulgarian village of Rahova (Cyan), famed for its rich gold mines. Their gold finances all unique units in the region, but most importantly the Janissaries in Darstor. The village relies on infantry for its defense, but if given time it will also build rams and go on the offensive.\n\n- All of Vlad's adversaries will construct warships so long as they have the supplies for them."

These are besieged from all directions: \n\n - Radu Bey (Cyan), Dracula's rival brother, attacks Fagaras from the west and north with Boyars, Pikemen, and rams. \n\n - The main Ottoman army (Purple) threatens Rasnov from the east with Cavalry Archers, Knights, and Petards, but may also construct Trebuchets. \n\n - Sultan Mehmed II 'the Conqueror' (Blue) marches on Poenari from the south. His elite vanguard consists of Long Swordsmen, Janissaries, and Bombard Cannons. \n\n - Several Wallachian villages (Yellow) are supplying Dracula's forces and are also potential trading partners.

Do not hesitate to construct Fishing Ships. The ocean offers plenty of food.\n\n4. As with any battle, tactics are important. Use proper counter units when possible. Pikemen are more effective against cavalry than Crossbowmen or swordsmen, and Cataphracts are versatile troops that are especially deadly to infantry."

Louis will train Pikemen, Crossbowmen, heavy cavalry, and swordsmen to defend his siege camp. Although he commands a disciplined army, he may occasionally rely on Byzantine help to fend off Saracen attacks. \n\n- The Saracen Army (Yellow) has erected four camps near Bari, threatening Louis' forces. The Saracens will launch attacks against both you and the Franks. Their army consists of Pikemen, Genitours, camelry, mounted archers, Light Cavalry and Knights. It is quite likely that they will also construct siege weapons such as Battering Rams. \n\n- Matera (Orange) lies to the west. The city is allied with the Saracens and will train Genoese Crossbowmen, Archers and Spearmen. \n\n- Oria (Cyan) is situated to the north.

Because of its excellent siegecraft and powerful infantry, the Holy Roman army is probably your most threatening opponent.\n\n- The Papal States (Green) should also not be underestimated. Expect fierce attacks comprised of archery units and swordsmen. In addition, the Papacy will make use of Battering Rams to assault your Castle.\n\n- In the south is Capua (Blue). This city has remained loyal to Boioannes thus far, but it is possible that the enemy could capture it and force its population to fight against you.\n\n- Rumor has it that some leaderless Norman Mercenaries (Yellow) have camped near the mountains.

It is not necessary to defeat him, but his Condottieri, Cavaliers, and Hand Cannoneers are a potent threat.\n\n- The Florentines (Orange) are in league with the Venetians against Visconti.

The Incas can build fishing ships, but don't know how to construct war vessels yet.\n\n3. Strategically placed walls can be very beneficial and can minimize the risk of getting overrun by your opponents.\n\n4. You do not have to exterminate your enemies completely. To win, you only have to take posession of at least three artifacts."
65009	"Your scouts report:\n\n- The Inca (Cyan) have established a small camp to the Southeast of the map. They will need to fortify their settlement soon to be secure against attacks.\n\n- The Cuyos (Blue) control the west of the map. Their army, mostly consisting of Slingers, Skirmishers and rams, is well-trained and can pose a threat to you. Allegedly, the Cuyos are in possession of at least one artifact.\n\n- The Tambos (Purple) are a rather insignificant tribe, living in the Southwest. It should be easy to defeat them for they have very few warriors who are moreover poorly equipped. It's possible that they own an artifact though.\n\n- The Quechua (Orange) might attack you in the beginning, but have an open mind about forming an alliance with the Incas. They will train Skirmishers, Archers, swordsmen and Eagle Warriors.\n\n- In the north, the Chanca (Red) have built a strong fortress. Since the Chanca are an expanding power, it is very likely that they will become your main opponent. They will send Archers, Eagle Warriors and Kamayuks into battle. It would not be surprising if the Chanca had also succeeded in capturing an artifact."
65010	"<AQUA>Eagle Warrior: Without the blessing of the Gods, the power of the Inca will sit on a foundation of sand. Let us capture as many holy artifacts as we can to prove that we are worthy of their favor!"

It could be of advantage to secure fords with walls and gates.\n\n4. The Inca can't build docks or war vessels to protect their city for Cuzco is located in the highlands.\n\n5. Your allies will provide you with food and lumber as long as you protect them from the Chanca invaders."
65109	"Your scouts report:\n\n- The Inca army (Cyan) has assembled in the West of Cuzco to face the Chanca forces.\n\n- Cuzco (Blue), the Inca capital, is located to the northeast. The city is not very fortified yet and therefore could easily be taken by the Chanca. An enemy commando operation has already succeeded in destroying the Temple of the Sun, the town's landmark.\n\n- The Chanca (Red) have built a circumvallation around Cuzco and will soon attempt to take the city by assault. Their army consists of Archers, Slingers, Eagle Warriors, swordsmen and Skirmishers. It is very likely that they will also make use of siege weapons, such as rams and Mangonels.\n\n- The elite of the Chanca warriors (Purple) is led by Anccu Hualloc himself, whose main camp is in the south. Anccu Hualloc will send Kamayuks, Slingers and especially Onagers and Capped Rams into battle. It might be that he will also decree the deployment of Trebuchets.\n\n- The tribes of Cana (Orange) and Canchi (Green) are allies of the Inca. They barely have soldiers, but they will try to support the defenders of Cuzco by supplying them with resources. If attacked, they will need your support, as neither the Cana nor the Canchi will have the ghost of a chance against the Chanca forces."

However, it is possible that enemy patrols swarm out and take the initiative."

However, his troops initially have no Villagers and no siege weapons.\n\n- Urqu (Yellow) hides in the east, in the mountain fortress Calas (Green), which is defended by Archers and Swordsmen.\n\n- To stop Pachacut's army, Urqu has stationed many of his men (Blue) in the mountains to lure Pachacuti into an ambush. You'll have to expect attacks from Skirmishers, Slingers, Archers, Spearmen and Eagle Warriors.\n\n- Most of the Chanca soldiers (Red) have withdrawn after the defeat of Cuzco. However, a few warriors are still in the region. If you find a Chanca camp, you can plunder it.\n\n- Pachacuti's exploits are on everyone's lips, therefore Locals (Grey) will join your troops when they set eyes on their hero. In this way you can get villagers and buildings. Leaderless Inca soldiers (Purple) will also join you when they meet Pachacuti.

65309	"Your scouts report:\n\n- The Inca armies (Cyan) have mustered in the east and south. You should start by building two base camps before invading the Chanca territories.\n\n- To the north is the capital of the Chanca, Waman Karpa (Purple). The city is heavily fortified, so make sure you bring along siege weapons. The army of Waman Karpa is composed of Archers, Battering Rams and infantry such as Kamayuks and Eagle Warriors.\n\n- Andahuaylas (Green) is located in the southwest and will attack early. The city will train Skirmishers, Slingers and Scorpions, but will also build rams if given enough time. In addition, Andahuaylas also has a few warships. If the Inca build a fleet as well, Andahuaylas will send its vessels into battle.\n\n- Another important city of the Chanca is Abancay (Blue), which is located in the east. The city is less fortified than Waman Karpa, but has a well-trained army and a small fleet guarding the city's docks. Abancay will mainly be sending Eagle Warriors, Pikemen and Mangonels.\n\n- Anccu Hualloc (Red/Orange) has built a fortress in the center of the map, in which he entrenched himself with his army. Anccu Hualloc's forces consist of Archers, Eagle and Jaguar Warriors, as well as several warships. If the Inca manage to kill Anccu Hualloc, this would damage the morale and discipline of the defenders of Waman Karpa.\n\n- The tribes of the Colla (Grey) were recently subjugated by the Inca and are obliged to participate in the war against the Chanca by sending troops. Once the Colla have sent reinforcements, you will be in charge to command their warriors.\n\n- The local priesthood (Yellow) regard the Inca with favor. Maybe the priests can be convinced to join your army."

65316	"<PURPLE>Chanca Soldier: The Inca know no mercy! They have destroyed a second castle!"
65317	"<AQUA>Eagle Warrior: The defenders of Waman Karpa have only one castle left to retreat to. If we destroy it as well, they will finally capitulate!"

The chiefs of the city have promised to let the Inca army enter their city. In case they do not keep their word, the Incas will have to conquer Pachacamac. The army of the city consists of Plumed Archers and swordsmen. If these are defeated, only a few soldiers will remain to defend the city.\n\n- To the north is the Kingdom of Chimor, which is defended by a powerful army (Orange) that owns three large base camps. The Chimú Army also controls the cisterns that provide their kingdom with drinking water. Should it come to a fight, the Chimú will send Slingers, Archers and Swordsmen as well as siege weapons into battle.\n\n- Chan Chan (Blue), the capital of Chimú, lies high in the north, in the middle of a barren desert. As long as the city has access to drinking water, it is difficult to take it. But if the Inca succeed in taking control of all the Chimú cisterns, it will be easy to conquer Chan Chan.\n\n- The navy of the Chimú (Purple) controls the ocean to the west.
