You are restricted to a population limit of 200.\n\n3. Choose carefully which Town Center you save. They each have different advantages.\n\n4. The Luni River is teeming with fish, but you will need to weaken the Bhadanakas to control the river.\n\n5. If you seek Relics, know that one will appear at random in an enemy town. Scouting is key to finding it.\n\n6. Rajasthan is filled with eager Rajput warriors. If you find them, they will serve Prithviraj."
65509	"Your scouts report:\n\n- Prithviraj's tiger hunt has been interrupted by rebellion. His cousin, Nagarjuna (Red), seeks to rule the Chauhan clan. He raids from the west with cavalry, camels, and archers.\n\n- The Rajput clans rival Prithviraj's Chauhan and each other. The Bhadanakas (Green) and Chandelas (Yellow) war over the floodplain. Prithviraj can take advantage of their rivalry to defeat or bypass them.\n\n- The Paramaras (Purple) command Abu, a Rajput holy site. They will not stray far from their mountain temple, which they defend with Monks and Elephant Archers.\n\n- Finally, the Ghaznavids (Cyan), horsemen of the west, have set their tents in the Thar Desert across the river in the north."

Although he cannot outrun the beast for very long, even a few moments will help him recover his health.\n\n3. The Rajput clans war with each other as much as with Prithviraj. Take advantage of this infighting by striking your enemies when they attack each other.\n\n4. The Chaulukya, Soomra, and Lohara will become your allies when their Kings are dead. Take care to not cause too much destruction in their lands.\n\n5. Though Jayachandra is your chief rival, it is not necessary to defeat him. By killing the rajas and destroying the Naga, Prithviraj will have victory."
65609	"Your scouts report:\n\n- Prithviraj has resumed his hunt, but enemies force him back to Ajmer. He will need to defeat the rival rajas to rule Rajasthan.\n\n- Jayachandra (Red) has begun his conquests by seizing the territory between the Ganga and Yamuna Rivers - perilously close to Ajmer. His army is diverse but he prizes his Elephant Archers above all.\n\n- The Chaulukya (Purple) command the seas from the Gujarat Peninsula southwest of Ajmer. They have a formidable navy and armies of camels and cavalry.\n\n- The Soomra (Yellow) control the Indus River from their coastal base in the delta to the west. They have borrowed cavalry and archer tactics from their former Muslim overlords.\n\n- The Lohara (Cyan) defend the Kashmiri mountains to the north with infantry, skirmishers, siege, and Monks.\n\n- Finally, various other factions challenge Prithviraj. The Naga (Green) are fierce serpent people of the southern forests while the Dacoits (Orange) are bandits pushed to the desert and mountain fringes, where they ambush passing travellers."
65610	"<BLUE>Kaimbasa: Follow the animal bones, my raja, and you will find your prey. Be careful. Not even a raja can stand toe-to-toe with the mighty tiger."

Forming an alliance with the longtime rival of the White Huns, the Gokturks, will help you in defeating the White Huns.\n\n5. If you are low on gold, establishing a trade route with the trading post at the other end of the Silk Road will turn a great profit.\n\n6. Cavalry Archers dominate these plains - countering them with Halberdiers and Elite Skirmishers will be the most cost-effective solution. A more costly but also viable strategy is using Persian heavy cavalry and War Elephants.\n\n7. Savaran are Persian heavy cavalry that can regenerate. They come at a great price but are worth their weight in gold."
66009	"Your scouts report:\n\n- There are several small Persian villages (Orange) scattered across Khorasan. As they are on the edge of the empire, they are unprotected and vulnerable to nomadic raids.\n\n- To the north live the tribes of the Gokturks (Purple). Little is known about these nomadic people, except that they train Cavalry Archers and Light Cavalry.\n\n- To the east, the White Huns (Blue) have captured several fortifications and are threatening the Persian Empire. For now, they are satisfied with our annual tributes of gold, but sooner or later they will make open war on Persia. Their army consists of Mangudai, Light Cavalry, and Cavalry Archers, as well as swift siege engines.\n\n- The lucrative Silk Road, a trade route stretching from China to Europe, winds through this land."

66109	"Your scouts report:\n\n- The soldiers of Balaj Chan K'awiil (Cyan) are defending a ford against the forces of Calakmul but the Calakmul army outnumbers them.\n\n- Dos Pilas (Yellow) is a small city aligned with its founding city, Tikal. Dos Pilas will train Eagle Warriors, Spearmen and Archers. \n\n- Tikal (Orange) is a huge city located to the east. They will train a host of different units like Eagle Warriors, Monks, Skirmishers and Scorpions. Their unique unit, the Slinger, will tear apart any infantry which comes near it.\n\n- Calakmul (Purple) is another colossal city, located in the north of Dos Pilas. Just as Tikal, their military will be diverse, training Eagle Warriors, Monks, Archers Swordmen and Mangonels. Their unique unit, the Jaguar Warrior, will be a pain to fight against in hand to hand combat. Taking them out from a distance with our archers is the best option.\n\n- Uaxactun (Blue) is another small city siding with Tikal. They will be training a small army of swordsmen, Spearmen, rams and Archers to fight their opponents.\n\n- Naranjo (Red) is probably the smallest city in the area. Their military consists of Eagle Warriors, Plumed Archers, mangonels and Archers. The ruler of Naranjo is not aggressive and prefers to focus on defences.\n\n- The Mayan Raiders (Green) are a pain for everyone. They roam the countryside around Dos Pilas and harass unsuspecting victims. It is believed they are being paid by either Tikal or Calakmul, or both."

66308	"1. The Magyars can support a population limit of 100 when nomadic and 150 when sedentary. There are other restrictions as well (unique to this scenario), since they are a nomadic people. For example, the Castle Age research will only become available once the Avars are defeated, and the Imperial Age research will only become available once one of the other main factions—Great Moravia, East Francia, or the Bulgarians—is defeated.\n\n2. The Magyars gain resources from looting enemy buildings, and sending captured animals to their pen. They also capture enemy Villagers when they destroy an enemy Town Center.\n\n3. Think carefully about when you want to build your Town Center. You will lose the benefits of the nomadic way of life, and the conversion to a sedentary lifestyle will be slow. However, it will be difficult to hold on to nomadism for the entire game.\n\n4. The enemy will not sit idle while you raid, so keep them on their toes and harass their economies to keep them weak.\n\n5. The Bulgarians are a tempting target for raids, so you could consider opening hostilities and attacking their lands. Just be careful to not take on too many enemies at once."
66309	"Your scout reports:\n\n- The Magyars (Cyan) have left their old homeland on the steppe in exchange for the rich pastures of the Carpathian Basin in Eastern Europe. They rely on livestock and raiding to fuel their expansion - if that ceases, the only way to survive will be to become like the Europeans and build Town Centers, Houses, Castles, and Farms.\n\n- The Avars (Orange) reside next to the Magyars. Once a powerful nomadic people themselves, they are now scattered and weak. It is advisable to raid and pillage their camps in order to grow stronger. Their army consists of Cavalry Archers, Scout Cavalry, and Tarkans.\n\n- To the north, Great Moravia (Yellow) dominated Bohemia and its surounding lands for centuries, but they too have become weak because of internal conflicts and rivalries with their neighbours. They have a few Castles, but those can be easily evaded. The Moravians train swordsmen and Pikemen, which are no match for our mobile cavalry force.\n\n- East Francia (Red) lies to the west and is one of the strongest powers in the region. Prevously part of the great Carolingian Empire, they remain powerful even after its division and can field a powerful army behind the strong fortifications that defend their lands. They will train Crossbowmen, Skirmishers, heavy cavalry, Teutonic Knights, and Mangonels.\n\n- The Bulgarians (Green) to the south have no quarrel with the Magyars and are on friendly terms. However, that does not mean that they should be left in peace. They have many fortified bases, but their villages are poorly defended. They will train swordsmen, Light Cavalry, and Konniks.\n\n- There are rumors that the Byzantines (Blue) have sent a delegation to these lands to seek allies in their war against the Bulgarians. Their proposal may be of interest to the Magyars."

Rumor has it that the Byzantines have hired Europeans from Iberia to fight for them. \n\n- There are three minor Turkish factions in the region: Karesi to the west, Germiyan to the south and Candar to the east. \n\n- Karesi (Green) is the only Turkish faction with access to the water, and will construct warships to contest the Byzantine supremacy at sea. Their land force consists of Skirmishers, Cavalry Archers, Hussars, and siege units. Later, they will replace their Skirmishers with Hand Cannoneers. \n\n- Germiyan (Yellow) has a strong nomadic tradition and it is said that their horse archers never miss their mark. They will field an army of Light Cavalry, Camel Riders, and Cavalry Archers that they will use to launch regular raids on their enemies. \n\n- Candar (Cyan) has adopted the use of heavy cavalry and fortifications almost on par with those of the Europeans. Relying on their defenses, they will take their time before engaging their enemies in the field. They will train an army of swordsmen and heavy cavalry."

You can either destroy all enemy towers and ships blockading the lake, or, if you are running out of time, use your own ships to distract the enemy vessels by letting them take enemy fire.\n\n4. Shipments for the city of Nanchang are being sent from all directions, and they will arrive in different places on the lake. Make sure to clear the blockades in time, as you will lose if any shipment is sunk.\n\n5. It is possible to bribe the nearby pirates to help you fight the Han, but it will not be cheap.\n\n6.

66808	"1. The Berber army is restricted to the Castle Age and its population limit is 120. Furthermore, this campaign is set centuries before the use of gunpowder in Europe.\n\n2. The Berbers have access to a wide array of cavalry units that are light, inexpensive, and excel at outmaneuvering and countering most enemy units. Needless to say, they should form the core of your fighting force.\n\n3. The city of Cordoba and the Visigoth fortresses are well-fortified. You will require well-supported siege equipment to breach them.\n\n4. Fish are abundant in the Atlantic Ocean and the Alboran Sea, but beware of marauding Visigoth warships.\n\n5. If you run low on gold, you can trade across the sea with the Berber city of Ceuta to the south. Unguarded pirate hoards are also rumored to be located on various islands."
66809	"Your scouts report:\n\n- Tariq Ibn Ziyad's army (Yellow) has landed at Gibraltar and must defeat the army of the Visigoth king Roderic (Green) in order to establish a foothold in the region.\n\n- The army of the Visigoth king Roderic (Green) has assembled on the far side of the ford in the northwest and is comprised mainly of infantry units with a few supporting cavalry and ranged units. It is loosely unified, however, and will be demoralized beyond help should their leader fall in battle.\n\n- A pair of Visigoth fortresses (Cyan) in the northeast watch over much of the region, and their troops will aggressively resist any invader. The core of their armies is infantry, but they will employ small contingents of Light Cavalry and siege engines as well, and send warships to attack by sea.\n\n- In the north lies the well-fortified city of Cordoba (Purple), which must be taken if the Berber army is to control southern Iberia. Legions of Knights, Crossbowmen, Pikemen, and Monks will provide staunch resistance on the land, while their warships will defend the city from amphibious incursions.\n\n- There are a couple of local villages (Grey) spread across the region that may be willing to aid your war effort once Roderic's army is defeated.\n\n"
66810	"<YELLOW>Berber Horseman: Our great leader has been wounded! We must carry on the fight while he recovers."

66908	"1. The army of Tariq ibn Ziyad cannot yet reach the Imperial Age, but its population limit is 200. Additionally, Tariq's shipbuilders did not travel with him on this expedition, so building Docks or ships is impossible.\n\n2. Strike quickly at Toledo - the Visigoth garrison is weak, but messengers have been sent out to the surrounding towns and will return with reinforcements if you wait too long.\n\n3. Mountainous regions are rich in mineral resources. Additionally, if you run low on gold, you can trade with the city of Cordoba or a local trade post east of Toledo.\n\n4. Visit the locals in the countryside - they may have interesting information to share.\n\n5. The enemy towns are preparing to build Wonders as a mark of defiance - do not allow them to do so!"
66909	"Your scouts report:\n\n- The army of Tariq ibn Ziyad (Yellow) has gathered on a promontory just southeast of the city of Toledo (Grey), the Visigoth capital, which lies in the center of the map.\n\n- The Visigoth garrison of Toledo (Green) represents only a token defense of the city, and is comprised of infantry, Archers, and a few Scorpions. They have also erected several makeshift towers guarding the main gates and the bridge across the river Tagus.\n\n- The city of Cordoba and several local settlements (Orange) are situated in the east of the map. They will serve as valuable trade partners should your gold supply run low.\n\n\nFour of the surrounding fortified towns pose significant threats:\n\n- Seville (Blue) lies far to the south, and will field armies of Crossbowmen, Light Cavalry, Pikemen, and a few siege units.\n\n- Merida (Red) is situated in the southwest, and its formidable fortress complex is guarded primarily by Huskarls, Long Swordsmen, and Cavalry Archers.\n\n- Talavera (Purple) controls the far west of the map, and trains Knights, Light Cavalry, Skirmishers, siege units, and will also build ships to harass you from the river.\n\n- Guadalajara (Cyan) lies far to the north. Their army is composed of Huskarls, Pikemen, Skirmishers, and siege units. A small military camp also guards the mines in the mountains east of Toledo."
66910	"<YELLOW>Tariq: Across this river lies Toledo, the Visigothic capital. We should seize it quickly before word of our arrival reaches the nearby towns."

66918	"<YELLOW>Tariq: The heartland of Visigothic Iberia is under our control. Now we can truly establish our rule here."
66919	"<YELLOW>Berber Horseman: Tariq-agha, your ally Musa is gathering his forces at Cordoba. They should arrive to reinforce us in 30 minutes."
66920	"<YELLOW>Tariq: Messengers have informed the surrounding towns of our presence. We should prepare to meet their armies in battle!"

67008	"1. The Umayyad-Berber army can advance to the Imperial Age and support a population of 200.\n\n2. Your bases are divided and cannot be connected until the two southernmost Asturian fortresses are destroyed. Difficult as it might be, preserving both bases is vital due to their economic and strategic value.\n\n3. You can ignore the Kingdom of Asturias if you like, but its control of strategic locations and constant raids on your flank might make them a necessary target. Each Asturian fortress is also home to a precious holy relic - capturing them can greatly boost your gold income.\n\n4. In addition to being a potential trade partner, Theodemir of Murcia has pledged to occasionally provide your armies with tribute and military support.\n\n5. The Mediterranean Sea is an abundant source of fish, and a trade route to the Balearic Islands would be quite lucrative, provided that you can defend it from enemy vessels."
67009	"Your scouts report:\n\n- The Umayyad-Berber army (Yellow) advances in a two-pronged assault on northeastern Iberia. One camp, situated in the south of the map, is poised to strike at the Visigothic cities of Zaragoza and Narbonne, while the other is located in the far west near the Kingdom of Asturias.\n\n- To the far south lies the Visigothic realm of Murcia (Orange), an ally and dependency of the Umayyad Caliphate.\n\n- The city of Zaragoza (Green) guards the easternmost crossing of the Ebro river. Zaragoza will field an army of Knights, Pikemen, and Skirmishers, and a small navy safeguards the city from seaborne incursions up the Ebro river.\n\n- The city of Narbonne (Cyan) lies in the far northeast of the map on the Mediterranean coastline. Their army consists of infantry supported by auxiliary Light Cavalry. Their navy prowls the Mediterranean, eager to harass any attempts at fishing and trade.\n\n- The Kingdom of Asturias (Red) is by far the greatest threat. Multiple fortresses in strategic locations sprawl over the western half of the map, and their army of infantry, cavalry, and powerful siege engines will present a serious challenge to your forces.\n\n- The locals (Grey) on the Balearic Islands in the east of the map are willing trade partners and may allow you to use their mines."
67010	"<YELLOW>Berber Horseman: Our armies are poised to launch an offensive across the Ebro valley and into Septimania."

67108	"1. Navigating the terrain of the Pyrenees is difficult. Get accustomed to tight mountain passes and adapt your strategy accordingly.\n\n2. The enemy fortresses nestled in the mountains are nigh impregnable. If you encounter one, turning around and finding another route is the best course of action.\n\n3. You have no way of researching upgrades, but local villages may be impressed by your army and supply you with the upgrades you need.\n\n4. Protect your ranged units - their tactical value increases exponentially in this land of cliff paths and narrow passes.\n\n5. Throughout most of the map, the high walls of the mountains will protect your troops from the worst of the elements. Cliffed passes, however, are treacherous and exposed to the harsh winds. Units lingering in them for too long will begin to suffer damage due to exposure to the cold."
67109	"Your scouts report:\n\n- The army of Abd ar-Rahman al-Ghafiqi (Yellow) has assembled near a local village just south of the Pyrenees. Their objective is to cross the treacherous region and rendezvous with the Umayyad soldiers (Orange) who have made camp north of the mountain range.\n\n- A few local villages (Grey) dot the map, overlooking important junctions and mountain passes. Their location makes them apt resting places but seemingly little more.\n\nThree enemies pose a significant threat to the Umayyad army as it crosses the Pyrenees:\n\n- The Asturians (Red) are only a faint presence in this region, but their fortified bastion in the center of the map and well trained, heavily armored troops nevertheless pose a threat worth considering.\n\n- The Visigoths (Purple) prowl the eastern Pyrenees and are based in a fortress overlooking one of the major eastern passes. Their balanced army of infantry, ranged units, and cavalry will provide stout opposition to any who would pass their way.\n\n- The Basques (Green) are native to the western Pyrenees. Their army of light infantry, javelineers, and cavalry would normally only pose a token threat, but their adept strategic use of the terrain makes them deadly to even a better-equipped force."
67110	"<YELLOW>al-Ghafiqi: An Asturian fortress lies just ahead. We do not have the means to capture it - we should turn around!"
67111	"<YELLOW>al-Ghafiqi: This road leads to two enemy fortresses! Turn around at once!"
67112	"<YELLOW>al-Ghafiqi: Just beyond this outpost lies a Visigoth fortress! We must find another route."
67113	"<YELLOW>Berber Horseman: Sire, this road leads south into the maw of an enemy fortress! North is the way we want."
67114	"<YELLOW>Berber Horseman: A dreaded enemy fortress lies just down the road. Our destination is north, not south!"
67115	"<YELLOW>al-Ghafiqi: The main road to the southeast is guarded by two enemy fortresses. We must take the mountain pass to the northeast!"
67116	"<GREY>Visigoth: The passes through the Pyrenees are treacherous and crawling with enemy troops. You have a long and trying journey ahead of you."
67117	"<YELLOW>al-Ghafiqi: Brace yourselves for frigid winds and be wary of enemy ambushes. We must reach the allied camp on the other side of the mountains before the cold of winter claims us all!"
67118	"<YELLOW>al-Ghafiqi: We have braved the cruel wintry weather of the Pyrenees. Let us make camp, eat, rest, and then continue our conquests. Good work, men!"
67119	"<YELLOW>Berber Horseman: Our glorious leader—Allah save him—is dead! How can we continue our campaign now?"
67120	"<YELLOW>al-Ghafiqi: All of our supply carts have been destroyed! We cannot possibly hope to continue our journey without provisions."
67121	"<YELLOW>al-Ghafiqi: Our army has all but perished! Alas that I should lead my men to such destruction."

Upon the destruction of an enemy Monastery, an enemy army will rush from the nearest enemy city or fortress to the village you are attacking. These armies are too strong to fight and should be avoided at all costs.\n\n3. There are three suitable locations for you to establish your camp - one in the far south of the map, one in the east of the map, or you can choose to expand the camp you begin the scenario with. Each choice has different benefits and drawbacks.\n\n4. Fishing is plentiful in the Bay of Biscay, although your enemies will do their best to harass your fleet.\n\n5. Do not attempt to attack the fortresses of the Frankish army or the citadel of Bordeaux without advanced siege equipment.\n\n6. Several Relics lie scattered around the map - some within the walls of Frankish fortresses, and some nestled in the countryside."
67209	"Your scouts report:\n\n- The army of Abd ar-Rahman al-Ghafiqi (Yellow) has made camp in the south of Aquitania and has been conducting raids while awaiting reinforcements. Its sights are set in particular on the Frankish city of Bordeaux.\n\n- Three Aquitanian villages (Purple) lie in close proximity to the Berber camp. They are providing the Franks with supplies but are only defended by a token force and should crumble easily to a swift raid.\n\n- The city of Bordeaux (Blue) lies near the mouth of the Garonne river, boasting excellent fortifications and a strong land army of mixed composition. Their navy prowls the Bay of Biscay, picking off enemy ships at will.\n\n- The Frankish army (Red) is by far your most dangerous opponent. Numerous fortresses sprawl across the countryside, and hordes of battle-hardened Paladins, Throwing Axemen, swordsmen, and auxiliary troops will be a true test for the proud Berber cavalry."

Venturing into the desert and destroying their tents is the only way to end their raids.\n\n- Off the coast are the Canary Islands, territory of Spanish Castile. European treaties matter little on this frontier, however, and the islands would be a rich source of resources, provided the native Guanches (Purple) can be pacified.\n\n- The flagship of the Ottoman privateer Kemal Reis (Grey) has been seen off the coast, attacking Christian ships in support of the beleaguered Emir of Granada. Defeating him would be a boon to the war against the Moors and Ottomans.\n\n- And somewhere off the African coast, an expedition led by Duarte Pacheco Pereira has been rumored lost."

68109	"Your scouts report:\n\n- Francisco de Almeida and his son Lourenço are besieged at Fort Sant'Angelo in Cannanore after being betrayed by the Kolathiri Raja, ruler of the city.\n\n- The Kolathiri Raja (Red) commands elephants, camels, Light Cavalry, swordsmen, and archers. His city was a Portuguese ally during the reign of the previous raja, whose recent death sparked a succession dispute. The new raja seized the throne with the backing of the Zamorin and in return, has vowed to push the Portuguese into the sea.\n\n- The Zamorin (Green), the cunning ruler of Calicut, has elephants, camels, Cavalry Archers, swordsmen, Hand Cannoneers, and siege to assist the raja. His encampments outside Cannanore will be difficult to challenge directly but his supply lines to the south may be prone to infiltration.\n\n- Hindu Pirates (Yellow), led by the slippery pirate lord Timoji, occupy Anjediva, an island off the coast.

The death of his son Lourenço must be personally avenged so he cannot surrender the Viceroyship until those responsible for his son's death are destroyed.\n\n- Afonso de Albuquerque (Red) has landed with a letter from King Manuel appointing him as Viceroy. He is an overbearing taskmaster which makes his men easily swayed by promises of gold and divine intercession. Care should be taken to not inflict heavy losses on fellow Portuguese; they will be needed for the battle against Diu.\n\n- Diu (Purple), an island off the southern coast of the western peninsula, will be the focus of the coming battle. Governed by Malik Ayyaz, a Russian converted to Islam, Diu has elephants, camels, and Paladins inspired to battle by Imams. Malik Ayyaz is aided by Venetian engineers who have constructed Bombard Towers in his city.\n\n- Diu is also supported by the army of the Ottomans (Green). These Janissaries, cannons, and cavalry have camped at Surat across the Konkan River from the Portuguese position.\n\n- Amir Husain al-Kurdi commands the Egyptian Mamluks (Cyan). His fleet is based on the Gulf of Khambhat's northern shore. The Mamluk army has Mamelukes, Cavalry Archers, and siege supported by a detachment of Venetian Condottieri. The Venetians provide resources for the Mamluks through their trade embassies.

There are several enemy military camps on the riverbanks. Attacking them could be costly, but it will weaken Dagnajan's army.\n\n3. The rebellion in the neighbouring Nubian kingdom of Alodia is spilling into this region. Whatever side you take, the benefits may come in handy.\n\n4. Try not to waste any time. Dagnajan's army will be here soon, and the more that you do early on, the easier it will be to stop his mighty army.\n\n5. Explore the region well. There will be several opportunities for Yodit to exploit."
68509	"Your scouts report:\n\n- Yodit's army has arrived to the north in a more arid region. It will not be easy to obtain sufficient supplies here, so they will need to be spent wisely.\n\n- The Begemder kingdom (Cyan) lies to the east of Yodit's army and is allied with Dagnajan. They will try to delay Yodit while Dagnajan prepares his army. It would be a good idea to deal with them so that they can no longer help him. Their army consists of swordsmen, Crossbowmen, and Camel Riders.\n\n- Slightly to the south, Darginda (Orange) has fortified the pass leading to their kingdom. Helping them to secure the pass when the enemy army is on the move is a priority.\n\n- The Kingdom of Alodia is tormented by rebellions. It has no diplomatic relations with Yodit, but it would be wise to support either its rulers or the rebels to further Yodit's interests in the region. Alodian traders (Yellow) have set up a trade post to the west, and a bit further north, the Alodian rebels (Purple) have made their camp.\n\n- Dagnajan (Red) is the king of the mighty Aksumite Empire. He has several outposts along the river where he is gathering his army for an attack on the Kingdom of Darginda.

Look for other ways to feed your army.\n\n3. Ryazan is renowned for its siege engineers. Perhaps your soldiers will be able to locate plans for advanced siege equipment there.\n\n4. Your enemies rely on supply stores scattered around the map. Destroying these will allow you to claim the provisions for your own.\n\n5. A secondary Timurid army is marching through the Caucasus to reinforce Tamerlane. Take advantage of its arrival to catch your enemies in a pincer movement."
71109	"Your scouts report:\n\n- Tamerlane's army of cavalry (Purple) has arrayed itself on the eastern bank of the icy Kondurcha River. Facing them on the opposite side is Tokhtamysh's army of Light Cavalry, Cavalry Archers, Volga Bulgar horsemen, and Russian infantry.\n\n- To the northwest lies the Russian city of Ryazan (Grey), a dependency of Tokhtamysh. Its army consists mostly of Light Cavalry and Skirmishers led by the local Boyars.\n\n- The city of Astrakhan (Orange) lies to the southeast where the Volga meets the Caspian Sea. Its army initially consists of Keshiks and Pikemen, but will eventually field Kipchak cavalry and swordsmen.\n\n- Tokhtamysh's capital of Sarai is located in the center of the map. Sarai relies on an army of Mangudai and Light Cavalry, but may add siege engines to the mix as well.\n\n- To the southwest, where the Don River flows into the Black Sea, is the city of Azov (Green). Azov is defended by Boyars and swordsmen, but will deploy Pikemen to counter the Timurid cavalry forces.\n\n- Across the river from Azov is a colony of Venetian and Genoese merchants (Blue) that supplies the enemy forces. Destroying it would be quite a blow to their war effort.\n\n- The Golden Horde (Yellow) and the Volga Bulgars (Cyan) have camps in the west, north, and east of the map. Though initially loyal to Tokhtamysh, they may be persuaded to turn against him given the proper set of circumstances."

Harass their trade routes or, better yet, shut them down entirely."
71309	"Your scouts report:\n\n- Tamerlane's army (Purple) has camped in the north of the map near the Black Sea. The local fishermen will feed the army for a short time, but expanding early is imperative.\n\n- Directly to the southeast is Georgia (Red), a mere shadow of its former glory. Their ill-equipped army is no match for Tamerlane's horde.\n\n- The east of the map is controlled by the city of Baghdad (Orange), an enormously wealthy prize defended by camelry and Crossbowmen.\n\n- Far to the west lies the domain of Cilician Armenia (Blue). Their army of swordsmen and Light Cavalry is led by a core of Cataphracts.\n\n- Just east of Cilician Armenia is the city of Aleppo (Yellow). Aleppo's army of Spearmen and Monks should be little more than a nuisance to Tamerlane.\n\n- The city of Damascus (Cyan) lies in the southwest. Their army of camelry and Cavalry Archers may pose a threat initially, but without trade they are helpless.\n\n- The Mamluk Sultanate (Green) is your most dangerous foe.

Destroying outlying enemy camps and winning over auxiliary troops will increase your chances of victory.\n\n3. Avoid enemy power centers at all costs before you have fought off Bayezid's attack. Focus on raiding supply camps and convincing the Turkish auxiliaries to desert instead.\n\n4. Tamerlane has brought a large supply of gold with him, but it will not last forever. Quickly build up an economy and seek out new sources of income to finance your army.\n\n5. Gunpowder units are powerful. Beware those of the enemy, but use your own to your advantage."
71409	"Your scouts report:\n\n- Tamerlane's forces (Purple) have arrived in Anatolia, the heart of the Ottoman Empire, and must hurry to establish a camp.\n\n- Tamerlane's main adversary, the Ottoman Sultan Bayezid (Cyan), has marched his forces to the center of the map and camped there. When Bayezid launches his attack, be prepared to face Janissaries, Hussars, and Bombard Cannons.\n\n- Assisting Bayezid's army are several companies of auxiliary troops (Green), some of whose loyalties are dubious. The Sipahis of the Anatolian Beyliks field Cavalry Archers and Heavy Camel Riders, the Qara Tatars control a force of Tarkans and Camel Archers, the Wallachians bring Pikemen and Skirmishers, and the Balkan auxiliaries are comprised of Champions and Crossbowmen.\n\n- The Ottoman Empire (Blue) controls several minor supply camps scattered around the map, but operates mainly out of a dangerous mountain fortress far to the south. Expect to face the finest troops that the Ottomans can offer - Hussars, Janissaries, Cavalry Archers, swordsmen, and Bombard Cannons.\n\n- The Knights Hospitaller (Red) command the city of Smyrna to the west. This military order musters an army of crusader knights both mounted and afoot supported by Skirmishers, Monks, and powerful Trebuchets.\n\n- Taherten, a local Turkoman emir, rules the citadel of Erzincan (Yellow) in the east of the map.

The Cumans (Red) are horse archers, Knights, and Light Cavalry who also bring Battering Rams. The Tatars (Green) are more defensive, but will muster Trebuchets.

With the nearby town of Devnya under Ivan Asen's control, Ivaylo must find a way through the mountains to reach the pass before it is overrun.\n\n- In Ivaylo's way are Roman Infiltrators (Green) who will ambush him in the mountains. Fortunately, the priest Kozma may be able to find friends among the persecuted Bogomils, if he is able to speak with them.\n\n- The Romans (Purple) and Tatars (Yellow) attack the Bulgarians. The Tatars are mercenaries and will fight as long as the Romans are able to support them. The total defeat of both forces is not necessary, but crossing the Kamchiya River to reach Devnya will be difficult if they remain strong."

A Vlach prince named Radu Negru desires to kill the oligarch and free Wallachia from Hungarian domination. He could be a useful ally.\n\n- Nogai Khan's Golden Horde (Yellow) has enemies on its borders, but Nogai is preoccupied with finding a successor to Mongke Temur, the recently deceased Khan of the Golden Horde.\n\n- The Poles (Purple) hold the city of Kiev in the north while the Genoese (Green) defend their Black Sea trading post in Crimea with a strong navy.

If the Mongol scouts reach a tribe before Kotyan does, the tribe will be subjugated and will become hostile towards you.\n\n3. Kipchak horsemen have a less powerful attack than most mounted archers, but years of experience on the steppe has taught them to fire instantly. Use this strength to outmaneuver Mongol Cavalry Archers.\n\n4. A direct assault on the Mongol Castle will likely prove fatal.

It will take a sign of goodwill to earn their trust.\n\n- The Mongols (Orange) have an encampment to the east. It should be avoided until you have the siege equipment to take it.

Their princes are either dead or fleeing north, so little help is to be expected from them.\n\n- The Mongols (Orange) have taken all of the land east of the Dnieper River and are preparing to cross it. Their leader, Subotai, has arrived as well and will oversee the Mongol advance. Expect him to unleash hordes of Cavalry Archers, Mangudai, Light Cavalry, and siege engines.\n\n- The Tatars (Yellow) have managed to sneak across the river during the night and have made camp to the southwest. They plan to encircle the remaining Cuman tribes and attack them from behind. Kotyan must prevent this, or there will be no future for his people.

If you are having trouble with this challenge, observe your ally - he has done this before.\n\n 3. To lure a Boar, send one Villager to shoot it twice. If you only shoot it once, it may not follow you the entire way back. After you have shot it for the second time, task your Villager to return to the Town Center. Once the Boar is close to the Town Center, task your other Villagers to kill it.\n\n 4. Killing an animal with a military unit or a building like a Town Center or a Watch Tower—anything that is not a Villager—will spoil the meat and you will not be able to harvest it.\n\n5.

// Challenge 2
//

72608	"1. For more information about how to properly gather from Sheep and on how to lure Boars, check out the 'Early Economy' challenge.\n\n2. Exploring is very important in any game. You should immediately look for the two Boars and eight Sheep in the vicinity of your Town Center. After that, you need to find your Forage Bushes, your main Gold Mine, and the nearby herd of Deer. Most standard random games have 2 groups of Stone Mines and 3 groups of Gold Mines in total, so you should look for those as well. After that, you can start to search for the enemy players.\n\n3. You should use your most damaged Villagers to build Farms. That way, they are close to the Town Center and safe.\n\n4. You can see what tasks your Villagers are assigned to by cycling through the minimap mode.\n\n5. Age of Empires II: DE has introduced mixed queuing. This means that you can queue both technologies and units at the same time. Be sure to make use of this feature.\n\n6. Another feature that the Definitive Edition introduces is multitasking by using the Shift hotkey. For example, if you build a House while having a Villager selected and then Shift + right-click on a tree, the Villager will go chop that tree immediately after it has built the House. This is a good way to avoid idling your Villagers, but will also take some time to get used to. Other uses for this feature include managing your Villagers gathering from Sheep or hunting Deer.\n\n7. In this challenge, you will be told to build a Market and a Blacksmith. These two buildings are the cheapest and therefore the fastest way to advance to the Castle Age.\n\n8. Skipping the Loom research is risky, but will allow you to advance to the next ages more quickly and speed your pursuit of a gold medal."
72609	"Your scouts report:\n\nWe have not gathered any information yet. You must instruct us to explore the surrounding region."
72610	"Click on your Town Center and queue multiple Villagers."
72611	"Have two Villagers build one House, and one Villager build the second House."
72612	"Use your Scout Cavalry to look for Sheep and other resources."
72613	"Send any idle or new Villager to collect food from Sheep. Do this until you have six Villagers collecting from Sheep."
72614	"The next Villager that you create must build a Lumber Camp. Do not forget to queue up more Villagers as well. When they are created, task them to collect wood."
72615	"Do not forget to keep training Villagers. Your Town Center should not fall idle."
72616	"Make sure that your Scout keeps on exploring. You need to find all eight Sheep and both Boars."
72617	"If you are relatively new to luring Boars, you should research Loom at your Town Center after your next Villager is trained. Experienced players can save Loom for later."
72618	"The next Villager that you create will have to build a House near one of the Boars."
72619	"Set the rally point of your Town Center on your Forage Bushes, and have the next Villager that you create build a Mill next to them."
72620	"Lure the Boar to your Town Center. You should know how to lure a Boar by now - if you do not, play the 'Early Economy' challenge."
72621	"If you do not have the food to create more Villagers, force your Boar hunters to drop off their food at your Town Center and then immediately task them back to the Boar."
72622	"Lure the second Boar with the next Villager that you create."
72623	"Have the next three Villagers also forage for berries."
72624	"Build another House."
72625	"Send the next six Villagers that you create to collect wood."
72626	"Build a second Lumber Camp to spread out your Lumberjacks. This will make your Lumberjacks more productive and ensure that you have two places to collect wood from in case of an enemy attack."
72627	"You will need another House after the next Villager is trained."
72628	"Send the next three Villagers to build a Mining Camp and mine gold."
72629	"When your last Boar is depleted, send the idle Villagers to gather from Sheep."
72630	"When your Sheep are nearly exhausted, start building eight Farms."
72631	"You will have enough Villagers to advance to the next age once the next one is trained. Queue the Feudal Age research at your Town Center."
72632	"There is not much to do while you wait to reach the Feudal Age. Keep scouting and keep an eye on your Villagers to make sure that they do not go idle. Once you reach the Feudal Age, you will need 325 wood to build a Blacksmith and a Market."
72633	"Queue up two more Villagers while you wait for the Feudal Age to be researched. Have them and any other idle Villagers collect wood once they are created."
72634	"Now, task one Villager to build a Blacksmith and task two Villagers to build a Market."
72635	"Hint: If you have more than 900 food stockpiled, research Double-Bit Axe at your Lumber Camp. This is a very good early technology."
72636	"Great! Now, advance to the Castle Age!"
72637	"Excellent! You have completed this challenge. Hopefully you are happy with your time. If not, feel free to try again."

// Challenge 3

72708	"1. If you are having trouble with this challenge, observe your ally - he has done this before.\n\n 2. Building additional Town Centers increases your Villager production. Keep building them until you have three or four.\n\n3. Make sure that your Town Centers are always training new Villagers. Build Houses to keep pace with your Villager production.\n\n4. Use rally points to ensure that your newly-trained Villagers immediately begin working. \n\n5. Build a lot of new Farms. You will need the food for Villagers and for the Imperial Age research. You can also automatically reseed your farms by selecting a Mill and clicking on the button to the far right of the command tab (located in the lower left of the User Interface). \n\n6. To advance to the next age, you will need two Castle Age buildings such as a Monastery, University, or a Siege Workshop. A Castle alone also satisfies the requirement.\n\n7. Buy and sell resources at your Market to balance your economy when necessary."
72709	"Your scouts report:\n\n- You have just reached the Castle Age in a peaceful location. You are free to concentrate on your economy.\n\n- On the other side of the map is an allied base (Yellow). They will also try to boom, so you can watch their strategy."
72710	"You have just reached the Castle Age. Select your Town Center and train as many Villagers as you can with your remaining food. Set a rally point on trees for now."
72711	"The key to booming is ensuring that your Town Centers are always busy. I say 'Town Centers' because you will need more than just one! You now have enough Wood and Stone to build a second Town Center near the trees."
72712	"Great! Now make sure that this Town Center is busy by training Villagers there as well, but do not forget your first Town Center! Remember, your Town Centers should always be training new Villagers."
72713	"Your Villagers need Houses. Be proactive in building Houses to prevent your Town Centers from becoming idle. Monitor your population counter at the top of the screen."
72714	"You now have enough Wood and Stone to build a third Town Center. You may even want to a build a fourth Town Center later to speed up your Villager production."
72715	"Research economic technologies at the Lumber Camp, Mill, and Mining Camp to improve the gathering rate of your Villagers."
72716	"To advance to the Imperial Age, you will need gold and to construct either one Castle or two Castle Age buildings."
72717	"Monitor your resources. If you notice that you have a lot of wood compared with food, take Villagers away from wood and have them build Farms."
72718	"Great! Welcome to the Imperial Age! You still need to train 100 Villagers, but you can now research more economic technologies at the Lumber Camp, Mill, and Mining Camp."
72719	"Great! You now have 100 Villagers, but you still must advance to the Imperial Age to complete this challenge."
72720	"Well done! You have 100 Villagers and are advancing to the Imperial Age! Your economy is now powerful enough for you to build large armies and vanquish your enemies!"
72721	"You are close to being 'housed'. Construct Houses to keep up with your Villager production."

// Challenge 4

72808	"1. Each unit type has their own strengths and weaknesses. Think well about the type of rush that you want to execute. Common units to rush with are Men-at-Arms, Archers, and Scout Cavalry.\n\n2. Keep scouting your enemy. They may be preparing their defenses or showing a vulnerability that you can exploit.\n\n3. Never stop producing Villagers yourself. If your rush fails, you do not want to end up economically behind your enemy."
72809	"Your scouts report:\n\n- The enemy (Red) has camped to the northeast.\n\n- His gold mines lie near the front of his base and are very exposed.\n\n- He has two Lumber Camps: one in the east, and one to the north.\n\n- He has already herded and hunted most animals near his base, but he has placed a Mill near his Ostriches.\n\n- The enemy is not mining any stone."
72810	"It is time to take the fight to your enemy before he can bolster his defenses. Train an army and attack him. Kill 5 Villagers as quickly as possible."
72811	"Three soldiers are already enough units to attack with. The longer you wait, the stronger the enemy gets."
72812	"Now that you have a decent raiding party, you can start upgrading your soldiers. Only research technologies that will improve the units that you have trained."
72813	"Archers are a good offensive unit due to their range and decent attack. Research Fletching at a Blacksmith to increase their attack and range."
72814	"Militia are effective against Villagers, but are slow and their upgrades are expensive. Research the Man-at-Arms upgrade at the Barracks and the Forging upgrade at the Blacksmith to make them more dangerous attackers."
72815	"The speed and agility of Scout Cavalry make them excellent raiders. However, their high food cost can slow the growth of your economy. Research Forging at the Blacksmith and Bloodlines at the Stable to augment their offensive capabilities."
72816	"Skirmishers and Spearmen perform poorly against Villagers, so you may want to invest in other units."
72817	"Try to avoid approaching the enemy Town Center for now. You are not able to destroy it yet."
72818	"Keep an eye on your own economy while you attack the enemy. You want to keep collecting more resources and training Villagers, so as to not fall behind."
72819	"Keep on scouting the enemy base with your Scout. It is important to find weak points in its defenses."
72820	"To kill Villagers more effectively, block their path to their Town Center with your soldiers."
72821	"That is the first Villager down. Good job."

72823	"Three Villagers down - two more to go."

72908	"1. Keep training new Villagers.\n\n2. It is possible to fight back with Villagers if your enemy's units are weak, but try to avoid engagements where you are outmatched.\n\n3. Watch Towers are a great way to defend your economy, but they are also a big investment. Always make sure that melee units cannot approach them, either. Until you research Murder Holes, your towers cannot fire at adjacent enemy units."
72909	"Your scouts report:\n\n- We are facing one enemy player (Red). We do not know much about him, but we expect him to attack our base at any moment.\n\n- Many of our mines are located to the south, exposed to the enemy.\n\n- The gaps to the south of our base can be easily closed off with buildings or walls."
72910	"Advancing to the next age quickly can be important, but your opponents will try to prevent you from gaining this advantage! In this mission, we will try to advance to the next age while under pressure from attacking enemies."
72911	"Use your Scout to look for enemy buildings. You can anticipate an attack if you know what the enemy is training."

73008	"1. Incorporate the landscape into your tactical decisions. Cliffs and hills in particular can be used to your advantage.\n\n2. Use your units according to their respective strengths:\n\n- Archers are ranged units that are strong against Men-at-Arms and Spearmen, but weak against Skirmishers and cavalry units. They are best used in hit-and-run attacks against slower units.\n\n- Men-at-Arms are generic melee units that are especially strong against buildings and certain types of infantry, but are weak against cavalry and ranged units.\n\n- Spearmen deal considerable bonus damage to cavalry, but are weak against nearly every other unit.\n\n- Skirmishers are strong against Archers and Spearmen, but perform poorly against other units, especially because they cannot fire on units that are too close to them.\n\n- Scout Cavalry are strong against ranged units, but should avoid Spearmen or large groups of Archers."
73009	"Your scouts report:\n\n- A Feudal Age army consisting of Archers, Skirmishers, Men-at-Arms, Spearmen, and Scout Cavalry is at your disposal to repel the enemy attacks.\n\n- Your opponent (Red) has gathered a Feudal Age army as well and plans to invade your territory."
73010	"Welcome! In this challenge, you must defend several areas against enemy attacks. Choose the units that are best suited to fend off each enemy army and try not to lose too many of your own soldiers."
73011	"Consult the Hints section if you need a reminder about unit strengths and weaknesses."
73012	"The enemy is preparing to attack you. Study the composition of the enemy forces and choose the soldiers that you want to send into battle by selecting one of the unit types available to you."
73013	"The enemy is about to launch a second attack. Choose the right unit to repel these enemy Archers!"
73014	"Now the enemy is sending a group of Skirmishers! Choose the right counter and defend your land!"
73015	"Enemy Men-at-Arms approach from the south! We must stop them!"
73016	"Spearmen are about to cross the nearby ford to the west! Recruit some more units to repel them!"

73018	"Achieving the silver medal is no longer possible, but do not worry. Use the remainder of this attempt to learn more about army compositions. It will certainly help you in the future!"
73019	"The final battle approaches! This time, you are allowed to select two unit types with which to fend off the enemy. Try to use your units according to their strengths and weaknesses."
73020	"Did you notice the hills nearby? Units fighting from higher elevation have an attack bonus against enemy units at a lower level. Try to lure your enemy to the hills to use the terrain to your advantage."
73021	"Good job! The enemy has been defeated and this area is now under your control!"
73022	"Scout Cavalry: 45 hit points, 3+2 attack, 0 melee armor, 2 pierce armor, fast speed."

73108	"1. To destroy a Mangonel with ranged units, wait for it to fire and then use Flank Formation to open a gap and have your units fire on the Mangonel. After that, use Line Formation to avoid the next Mangonel shot. Repeat this until the Mangonel is destroyed.\n\n2. Scorpions are great against slow-moving, densely packed units like infantry. To minimize the damage that they inflict, use Staggered Formation.\n\n3. Use control groups to manage your units. To create a control group, select a group of units and simultaneously press Ctrl and one of the number keys (1-9). Then, to select the control group, press the number key that you assigned to it. You can have up to 9 groups at the same time.\n\n4. Use the terrain to your advantage. If you fight from higher ground, your units will deal more damage to the enemy units."
73109	"Your scouts report:\n\n- You begin in an allied encampment (Yellow) to the north and must travel down to the end point of the path south. The path is blocked by groups of enemy units (Red). You must destroy all of the enemy units to make it through. The enemy forces consist of Long Swordsmen, Pikemen, Elite Skirmishers, Mangonels, and Scorpions."
73110	"Welcome to the next challenge. Now, it is time for you to learn about battle formations and control groups."
73111	"The enemy has placed several obstacles on the path ahead. The first one is a Mangonel."
73112	"Approach the Mangonel and when it shoots, use Flank Formation to avoid its projectiles."
73113	"Excellent! The enemy has stationed several Scorpions at the next point. Your units are unlikely to avoid their bolts entirely, but using Staggered Formation will reduce the damage that they inflict."
73114	"I hope that you did not lose too many units. Your units have healed in preparation for the next roadblock. This consists of an army of swordsmen. Use the terrain to your advantage."
73115	"Those swordsmen were too slow for you. You will have to use control groups to overcome the next obstacle. Travel south until you encounter a group of Knights."
73116	"The Knights are few in number, but they are strong. Two groups of enemies wait ahead. Use control groups to split and manage your army while you engage them."
73117	"Well done! With some good management, you can deal with large numbers of enemies. Your last challenge will be the hardest."
73118	"A combined force of Mangonels and Pikemen blocks the final stretch. Use everything that you have learned to cut your way through it."
73119	"You have missed the chance to earn the gold medal this time, but the silver medal is still within reach!"
73120	"Earning the silver medal is no longer possible. Use the remainder of this attempt to learn more about battle formations. It will certainly help you in the future!"
73121	"That will show them! Great job! You have learned everything about formations and control groups, and can now try out the next challenge."
73122	"Your losses are too big. You can still finish the scenario victorious, but you will no longer be able to earn a medal."

73208	"1. Fire Ships are a great counter to War Galleys, but keep them away from enemy Demolition Ships.\n\n2. War Galleys can attack from a long range, but are powerless against the flames of Fire Ships in close combat. Use them in large groups to outnumber the enemy fleet, and, if possible, pair them with Fire Ships.\n\n3. Due to their area-of-effect attack, Demolition Ships will destroy or heavily damage most ships or groups of ships in a single devastating explosion. They are useful against any warship, but only if they can manage to reach it. They can also be devastating against Transport Ships and land units.\n\n4. It is not easy to maneuver a Demolition Ship close to an enemy ship. Distract your opponent with other ships before sending your Demolition Ships to attack.\n\n5. Do not hesitate to use your Demolition Ships--if destroyed, they will only count as losses if they do not reach their targets."
73209	"Your scouts report:\n\n- You command a respectable Castle Age fleet in the northwest near an allied village (Yellow).\n\n- Your goal is to reach the eastern end of the river. You will encounter enemy blockades (Red) along your way. The enemy fleets consist of War Galleys, Fire Ships, and Demolition Ships."
73210	"Welcome! In this challenge, your goal is to defeat the enemy fleet that is blocking the river. Try to lose as few of your own ships as possible in the battles ahead."
73211	"You do not have enough ships left to earn the gold medal, but the silver medal is still within reach!"
73212	"You have lost many ships. Achieving the silver medal is no longer possible, but defeating the enemy still is! Try to deploy your ships optimally according to the characteristics that you have learned."

73308	"1. Most siege weapons can only be constructed in your Siege Workshop. An exception is the Trebuchet, which is available only in the Imperial Age and can be produced in your Castle.\n\n2. Battering Rams are the most effective siege weapons available in the Castle Age for tearing down enemy buildings and fortifications. Mangonels are effective against ranged units, siege weapons, and most buildings, but are extremely weak against fortifications that outrange them, such as Castles and Guard Towers. Do not waste resources and time constructing other siege engines.\n\n3. If you have a Castle, you can train Petards in it. These units can blow up enemy buildings, but it is important to array them in staggered formation to make Castle fire less damaging to the group.

To defeat the enemy, you will need to destroy the Castle. Your opponent will not go on the offensive, but will defend himself if you invade his realm."

To defeat your enemies in this scenario, you only have to destroy their Monasteries, their Castles, or their Town Centers. Do not bother with the rest.\n\n3. If you defeat an enemy, you will capture their supplies. Use these extra resources to fuel your attack on the next player.\n\n4. There are two paths to the Japanese Wonder. On each path lie different enemies with their own strengths and weaknesses. Make sure to use your own civilization's strengths to defeat each of them.\n\n5. Chat '200' to the Japanese to see all of the objectives and chat '201' to the Japanese to hide these objectives again."
73509	"Your scouts report:\n\n- Your ally (Green) has managed to conquer half of the city, but has not yet been able to cross the river and seize the other half. Go meet up with their army to gain control of it. \n\n- The fiendish Franks (Yellow) control the other half of the city. Kick them out! Their force consists of Knights, Spearmen, Throwing Axemen, and some siege units. \n\n- To the north are the brutal Burmese (Orange). They rely on Battle Elephants, swordsmen, Arambai, Scorpions, and warships to defend their petty base. \n\n- East of the Burmese are the malicious Malians (Purple). These desert dwellers have amassed a large army of Heavy Camels, Elite Gbetos, Heavy Scorpions, and swordsmen. They will not stop your mighty army!\n\n- To the south of the city are the atrocious Aztecs (Cyan). Their Eagle Warriors, Skirmishers, Crossbowmen, and Mangonels are no threat to our mighty cavalry forces, but beware of their monks. They are very annoying.\n\n- Next to the Aztecs are the savage Saracens (Grey). Not only do they have Arbalesters, Elite Mamelukes, Heavy Camels, and Siege Onagers; they also dominate the shallows with their Galleons.\n\n- Finally, there is our arch enemy, the jarring Japanese (Red). Entrenched on a cliff fortified with Keeps and Castles, they think that their massive army will be enough to prevent us from destroying their Wonder. They could not be more wrong. We will destroy their Arbalesters, Halberdiers, Cavaliers, Trebuchets, and Elite Samurai with impunity and tear their precious Wonder down brick by brick."

The Mongols cannot be trusted. Their ultimate goal is to subdue all of Southeast Asia!\n\n5. The castle in Kediri gets regular supplies over land which are used to train more soldiers. Blocking these supplies will help weaken their defences."
68809	"Your scouts report:\n\n- Our great ruler, Raden Wijaya (Orange), is rebelling against his overlord, Kediri. Here in eastern Java he plans to build a new kingdom named Majapahit.\n\n- The Mongols (Green) had sent diplomats in name of Kublai Khan to demand tribute from the Indonesian kingdoms. However the Javanese humiliated their diplomats and now a Mongol army has arrived on Java to punish them for it. Since we are both enemies of Kediri they might be willing to from a pact against them at one point. The Mongols have brought their famous horses with them and will raise an army of Light Cavalry, Cavalry Archers, Mangudai and siege units.\n\n- To the east are the Singhasari (Blue), a former strong kingdom, now dominated by the Kediri. They will be very aggressive and attack us with Crossbowmen, Cavalry Archers, Battle Elephants, Long Swordsmen and Mangonels.\n\n- To the west of us lies the fortified castle of the Kediri (Cyan). It is in a very strategic position and Kediri retains control of the surrounding villages from here. As long as they have the supplies, they will train Knights, Crossbowmen, Pikemen and Battle Elephants."

There is still a lot of support for the Majapahit king in this region, so it is a good idea to explore the area and search for those loyalists.\n\n4. King Jayanegara does not have much time, so you must hurry to his rescue before the rebels can kill him.\n\n5. There are three different gates closeby that can get you into the city. Each of them can lead to a different path to reach the king, some are easier than the others. Arya Tadah will help you breach the gates, direct him by using taunts. Chat '105' to tell him to attack the western most gate, '106' to attack the middle gate, and '107' to attack the eastern most gate."
68909	"Your scouts report:\n\n- Gajah Mada and his army (Red) has arrived to the northeast of the city. He has few assets initially, but can rely on the support of the loyalists near the capital.\n\n- Directly to the north, the prime minister Arya Tadah (Purple), has also arrived to help save the king and is awaiting Gajah's support to commence the attack.\n\n- The Majapahit king, Jayanegara (Yellow), is trapped within the city walls and is surrounded by hostile rebel forces. His royal guards are staunch defenders, but eventually they will succumb to the rebels attacks.\n\n- The city of Trowulan (Orange) has been occupied by rebels. The rebels have assigned their strongest men to hold the walls against attacks from outside the city. These defenders include Arbalesters, Champions, Battle Elephants, Onagers, and Halberdiers. The rebel army under the command of Rakrian Kuti (Blue) himself will be attacking the king. He has swordsmen, Karambit Warriors, Light Cavalry, and Crossbowmen at his command.\n\n- Outside of the walls, the remaining Majapahit Rebels (Cyan) guard the southern part of the city, making sure that nobody can escape.

Because of the restricted population limit and resources available it is a good idea to rely on fortifications to defend your islands against enemy ships.\n\n6. The Sunda will not go on the offensive unless you attack them first or expand into their territory. That is why instead of destroying them immediately you can choose to expand oversea first."
69009	"Your scouts report:\n\n- The Majapahit (Red) control the eastern half of the island of Java, while Sunda (Yellow) controls the western half. They will not attack us unless we provoke them but it might be in our interest to assert control over the island before expanding to the other islands. Sunda will train Skirmishers and Knights.\n\n- Our colonies (Cyan, Purple, Grey and Orange) will start colonizing Bali, Sulawesi, and Borneo. These islands are to the east and north of our island and are rich in resources.\n\n- West of Java, on the island of Sumatra, lies the kingdom of Dharmasraya (Green). The kingdom wields a strong force of Swordsmen, Crossbowmen, Ballista Elephants, Galleons, and Fire Ships. Dharmasraya is the most likely to regularly attack us.\n\n- To the north lies Malaysia, part of the Asian continent. Here the Tumasik (Blue) have broken free from their former overlords and have built the mighty city of Singapore. They compete with us over the control of the sparsely inhabited islands which we are trying to colonize. They focus on destroying our colonies before attacking our home island.

69108	"1. Due to the limited resources and space on these small islands, you are restricted to a population limit of 125. This also means it is very important to expand quickly to other islands to take control of vital resources and precious building space.\n\n2. Fish is probably the best way to get food in this region. Doing this saves wood from building farms and that wood can instead be used for building a navy. When fishing spots become depleted you can make use of the Malay's unique fish trap bonus to get an endless supply of food that way.\n\n3. Your enemies have a strong naval presence. Building fortifications on the islands can help defend your bases and let you concentrate your ships in fewer locations.\n\n4. Some enemies have Fortified Towers. The best way to deal with these large towers is with several Cannon Galleons. Using other ships to distract the fire coming from the towers is also a good way to prevent your Cannon Galleons from taking fire."
69109	"Your scouts report:\n\n- The Majapahit navy (Cyan), or what is left of it after a heavy storm, arrived north and made landfall on one of the islands. Majapahit sailors (Red) have been ordered to look for a nearby village from where a new fleet can be build.\n\n- To the east the Kutai (Blue) control many of the smaller islands. They are mainly pirates and rely on small but fast ships. They will also use rafts filled with gunpowder to take down larger vessels.\n\n- The Makassar (Green) live on the other side of the eastern archipelago and southwest of our location. They are well-fortified and better equipped then the Kutai. They mainly rely on War Galleys and Fire Ships to deal with enemy vessels but also have archers defending their shores. We definitely can expect them to try to raid us.\n\n- Farther to the south are the Luwu (Yellow). The most technologically advanced of the islanders, their island will be very difficult to take because of the Fortified Towers defending it. They are also accustomed to using gunpowder so they will deploy cannons on some of their vessels and towers."

Their Elephant Archers, Champions, Crossbowmen, and Light Cavalry make for an impressive army, but they will require aid if they are to survive the Tambralinga and Srivijaya onslaught.\n\n- The Tambralingas (Orange) recently suffered a defeat at the hands of the Chola arrivals, but are far from broken, having struck out and established two military bases to the northwest of the Khmer lands. Their light infantry and Skirmishers will harass their enemies by land, while their navy will attempt to keep the Khmer and Chola forces divided.\n\n- The Srivijaya (Blue) command a vast thalassocratic empire from their power base in the south of the map.

The Chinese general Wang Tong relies heavily on supplies and reinforcements arriving from China. You should try to intercept as many as you can so that he does not become too strong."
70709	"Your scouts report:\n\nLe Loi has sent his Vietnamese commanders (Yellow) to three different locations:\n\n- To the north, Le Trien, the champion of the Vietnamese rebels, has orders to intercept Ming reinforcements arriving from China.\n\n- To the east, Dinh Le, commander of the rebel cavalry, prepares to lay siege to Nghe An.\n\n- To the west, the wise Bui Bi and master marksman Luu Nhan Chu are to secure the rich rice fields, dealing with the Ai Lao people if necessary and then perhaps attack Nghe An from the west.\n\n\n- The city of Nghe An (Cyan) is situated to the south and is vital to the Ming dominance of the region. Its defenders rely on its strong fortifications and have stored gunpowder in the city, allowing them access to advanced units such as Bombard Cannons and Hand Cannoneers.\n\n- General Wang Tong (Purple) has a camp to the northeast. He can field an army of Cavaliers, Chu Ko Nu, Elite Skirmishers, and Halberdiers, but only has limited resources and relies primarily on Ming reinforcements (Blue) from China.\n\n- The people of Ai Lao (Green) are not directly involved in the conflict, but they do have something to gain from the situation. If given the opporunity, they will turn on Le Loi. They field an army of Battle Elephants and infantry."

It will be a while before they go on the offensive, but be prepared to face the full might of the Chinese when they do.

// 01 - William Wallace

201101 "We are without a leader. The dead king of Scotland has no heir."
201102 "War creeps in from the south, where Edward Longshanks, the avaricious King of England, has returned from successful campaigns in Wales and France. As Longshanks turns his attention to Scotland, the shadow of fear settles across the Highlands."
201103 "The English have thousands of Welsh longbowmen, hundreds of knights on horseback, and dozens of siege weapons."
201104 "We Scottish have a rabble of untrained soldiers who do not even know how to march in a straight line. We must act soon. If we are to have any chance of resistance, we need to forge an army by any means necessary."
201151 "Scotland has soldiers now, if only a few. But if we are to turn back the greed of Edward Longshanks, we will need many more recruits, and much more gold in our coffers."
201152 "These ancient stones and oaks around us will soon be drenched with the blood of clansmen."

201201 "An army marches on its stomach, or so the old saying goes. My clansmen have been farming and tending sheep for hundreds of years...but gathering enough food to feed an army is a different matter entirely."
201202 "Without a strong economy, the meager forces that we have cobbled together will collapse again."
201251 "Edward Longshanks, for all his disrepute, has shown his military tactics in Wales, England, and France to be very effective, if not cruel and ruthless. He is indeed an enemy to be feared. The English sacked the town of Berwick-upon-Tweed. With that I could call it a battle, but it was truly more of a massacre."
201252 "Unless we organize our army, there will be more massacres to follow. I pray that we can be ready when Longshanks comes."

201301 "In villages throughout the Highlands, there is grim talk of skirmishes between Scotland and England. We lost the town of Dunbar this week. Scottish defenders broke ranks and fled. The English have an army that is larger and better trained."
201302 "To compete with them, we are going to need new recruits to pick up spear, sword, and bow. We must transform these shepherds into soldiers."
201351 "Now that we have militias stationed across the border, the English have slowed their raids. But facing Longshanks' army will be another matter. The wicked English king has yet to bring his famous longbows to bear."
201352 "Our militias can only get us so far. We are going to need more advanced weapons."

201401 "Rumors creep in from the south of a giant who leads the forces of Scotland, his great sword driving through earth, man, and horse alike. If this mythical knight can stall the English advance, it will give us time to develop the arms we need."
201402 "Even now our smiths are forging swords, and fletchers are crafting arrows and crossbow bolts."
201451 "Longshanks has invaded, stormed, and sacked the city of Perth. Worse, he has captured the fabled Stone of Scone and declared himself King of Scotland."
201452 "If we cannot bring about a victory in battle soon, the Scottish armies will be too demoralized to put up any fight at all. If this mythical Scottish giant does exist, I wish that he would bring his forces up to Stirling, where we shall next do battle."

201501 "The time for minor skirmishes is over. We now prepare for war."
201502 "The villain, Longshanks, is poised to cross the River Forth and threaten the town of Stirling with a force of men-at-arms, heavy cavalry, and a multitude of archers."
201503 "Our newly forged army marches southward to establish our own base and attack the English before they can ready their troops."
201551 "Stirling was our first great victory. Even as we held the coastline, word arrived that Stirling Bridge had been held by a force of Scots led by the mythical knight of whom so many have spoken."
201552 "Now we know his name: Sir William Wallace, the bane of the English."
201553 "Edward Longshanks names Wallace a traitor and a criminal. Sir William replies that he cannot be a traitor, for he never swore fealty to an English king."
201554 "With Wallace leading our armies, the men fight with renewed vigor. Perhaps the tide of our misfortunes is about to turn..."

201601 "Our coffers were depleted at the Battle of Stirling, so we need to strengthen our economy once again before pushing south into lands held by the English."
201602 "We need to construct a market and establish trade routes to the villages of friendly clans."
201603 "Local legends speak of three sacred relics hidden south of Stirling. Acquiring these artifacts for Wallace's army will be a great boost to Scottish morale."
201651 "With the three relics locked away safely in Scottish churches, men murmur that we are blessed by the heavens."
201652 "Our army now stands a chance as we prepare for the final clash with the English.  Scotland now has archers and knights of our own with which to meet Longshanks."
201653 "We march south, to Falkirk, where we will join with the army of William Wallace and plan our combined attack upon the English castle."

201701 "The only way that we can hold the boggy lowlands around Falkirk is to build a castle and as many walls as we can construct in a short time."
201702 "These fortifications will serve to protect our camp as we construct siege weapons with which to assault the English castle."
201703 "Once the castle is constructed, Wallace himself has sworn to join our forces. Together we will attack Longshanks and his English troops."
201751 "It looked certain that we would be defeated at Falkirk. Yet somehow, though outnumbered and outranged by English longbows, we were victorious."
201752 "The English castle was torn down, and a Scottish one shall be built in its place."
201753 "William Wallace has shown us the path to victory. Although he is but one man, he inspires great deeds in others. Many of the Scottish knights and lords have drawn their swords with his."
201754 "Wallace's own sword is a five-and-a-half-foot beast, forged of course in Scotland."
201755 "He has sworn not to rest until his sword finds the neck of Edward Longshanks. The struggle will continue, but we have learned the ways of war. Now it is the English who will know true fear."


// 02 - Joan of Arc

202101 "February 19, Army Camp near Vaucouleurs."
202102 "This morning I awoke to visions of fire and steel. These nightmares come more often now that I have seen my beloved France eaten away by years of war."
202103 "I wandered through camp ignoring the new snowfall, but observing the wounds and weariness of every soldier under my command. Observing the desperation in their eyes."
202104 "It was then that I first saw the girl. She told us that her name was Joan. She told us she was but a peasant, who did not know how to ride or fight. She told us that she intended to rescue France. The darkness lifted from the men's souls."
202105 "Her voice rang with conviction, and we drank in her every word. I may have lost my faith, but Joan has not lost hers, and that is enough for me."
202106 "Joan has asked our ragged band of soldiers to take her to Chinon, where the rightful ruler of France, the dauphin, hides from his foes."
202107 "The war-torn land in between is infested with enemy marauders, and we will lose many men.  Death is by now an old companion, but for Joan, we will face it again."
202151 "As Joan's footsteps echoed down the marbled hall of the château, the fat and whispering dukes did naught but stare."
202152 "The dauphin himself seemed afraid as she kissed his feet. 'My gentle dauphin,' she demanded, 'why does England claim what is ours? Why are you not crowned King of France as is your right?'"
202153 "The courtiers began to murmur. The chamberlain whispered lies into the dauphin's ear."
202154 "But the dauphin pushed the chamberlain away and rose to meet Joan's gaze."
202155 "She stands only to the shoulder of the shortest man, but all of us must look up to speak to her."
202156 "I know not what silent conversation passed between the dauphin and his would-be savior, but it was obvious that his Majesty was in the same thrall as we."

202201 "March 26, Chinon."
202202 "It is one thing for a band of dispirited soldiers to put their trust in a teenage girl. It is entirely another for that girl to be given command of the army of an entire nation."
202203 "We were filled with pride when we heard the dauphin's heralds pronounce Joan the Maid as commander of the army of France."
202204 "So that she may look like a general, the dauphin presented Joan with a great warhorse and a suit of white armor."
202205 "Joan instructed me to look for an ancient sword buried beneath the altar of a local church."
202206 "I was skeptical, but not only did the men unearth a rusted blade, but we found that the sword had belonged to Charlemagne, grandfather of France. I shall not doubt her word again. Still visible on the hilt was the fleur-de-lis."
202207 "Joan adopted the fleur-de-lis as her symbol and had it blazoned upon her battle standard. Wherever Joan goes, the standard goes also. It goes with us to Orléans."
202208 "The city of Orléans is one of the finest in France, but it is under siege by our enemies, England and Burgundy, and is about to fall."
202209 "This war has dragged on for one hundred years with precious few French victories. The people of Orléans need a savior. They will receive Joan of Arc."
202251 "Joan prophesied that she would be wounded at Orléans. At the height of the battle, an arbalest bolt knocked her from her horse. We could not believe our misfortune."
202252 "But as we carried Joan away from the carnage, the battle was won. Orléans was free."
202253 "When we entered the city, the entire population cheered us on from windows, rooftops, and city streets."
202254 "They fired artillery into the night sky and shouted aloud their nickname for Joan: 'La Pucelle'-The Maid of Orléans."

202301 "June 14, Orléans."
202302 "Our rescue of Orléans was a setback for our enemies, but only a minor one. The English still possess half of France."
202303 "Tragically, we have cooled our heels for weeks while the dauphin's advisors debate."
202304 "Joan became irritated with the delay and reassembled her army. She talks of nothing but her mission to drive the English into the sea."
202305 "The force of Joan's will is titanic. She has gathered to her banner swearing brigands and knaves and turned them into patriots and heroes."
202306 "Among them is the man La Hire. A giant clad in plate mail; he drives men on with curses and fists. There will be plenty of English necks for La Hire to break at Patay."
202307 "Patay is the gateway to the Loire River Valley.  The English hold the Loire in a grip of steel, whilst a huge army under Sir John Fastolf devastates the countryside."
202308 "Joan leads us to Patay to capture the English castles. However, we must avoid Fastolf's army until we are strong enough to face his veterans."
202351 "After Patay, the myth of English invulnerability was dispelled. Now our army knows it is possible to win, but only if we are resolute and cunning."
202352 "The English are a most deadly enemy, and their longbowmen have decimated a charge of French knights time and time again."
202353 "To make matters worse, we now face enemies on both sides. The dauphin's advisors spend more and more time wrangling, jealous of Joan's influence at court."
202354 "I pray that Joan can complete her divine mission before the dauphin's envious advisors betray her."

202401 "June 25, Orleans."
202402 "Dead France is returning to life. Our army swells with new recruits. In olden times, men swore fealty only to their particular lord."
202403 "Now we fight not for insolent lords and ladies, but for France. For all of us, Joan is France. There is no distinction in our minds."
202404 "The dauphin himself has arrived in Orléans. Never have I seen such a celebration. France needs a king, so we must escort the dauphin to Rheims where he can be properly crowned."
202405 "Yet, the city of Rheims is dangerously menaced by the Anglo-Burgundian army. The cities of Troyes and Chalons also bar the way."
202406 "Joan commands that we must liberate all three cities before the coronation, and we eagerly seek to fight."
202451 "As we rode into Rheims, a sea of peasants and lords knelt before Joan. Some even knelt to kiss her horse's hoofprints. Cannon thundered and a thousand flags danced in the breeze."
202452 "In the enormous palace, the dauphin knelt before the archbishop and rose as King of France. Prayers, anthems, and sermons filled the great château."
202453 "Interspersed among perfumed dukes and ladies were tattered soldiers from our army, many still bearing wounds."
202454 "Joan herself was at the king's side, as was her bedraggled battle standard."
202455 "Despite the celebration, I know in my heart that this war is far from over. Our fathers and grandfathers died fighting the English."
202456 "Joan gives us hope, but I do not know if hope is enough to ensure victory."

202501 "September 3, Rheims."
202502 "France has a king once more. However, as Joan gains influence with the people, jealousy grows within the court."
202503 "The king's evil advisors now seek to destroy Joan. It is only a matter of time before they succeed in poisoning the king's mind."
202504 "Joan must hurry to fulfill her mission. Paris, the jewel of France, has been under English tyranny for decades, and French patriots trapped within the city are eager to escape. We are now marching on Paris, hoping that the reinforcements we have been promised will arrive in time."
202551 "Tragedy. As the refugees fled into the château of Compiègne, Joan was trapped outside. Burgundian soldiers knocked her from her horse and paraded around with their prisoner."
202552 "None of us can sleep, knowing our precious Joan of Arc languishes in a Burgundian prison."
202553 "The soldiers stare at the uncaring sky, condemning themselves for being unable to save her...for being unable to save France."
202554 "Paris was the first major defeat ever dealt to our army. Had the king sent the promised reinforcements, we would have captured the city. Now, it is France's darkest hour."

202601 "July 14, Bordeaux."
202602 "No Joan of Arc. A rich world made empty and poor! The English put her on trial as a heretic. Joan's mind was as sharp as her sword, and she avoided all the cunning verbal traps of her prosecutors."
202603 "In the end, Joan would not renounce her mission. The English found her guilty..."
202604 "...and burned her at the stake."
202605 "But her death is not in vain. 'La Pucelle' is the rallying cry as peasant and nobleman alike take arms. My army is an army of the people, and even without the king we are poised to strike at the English stronghold of Castillon."
202606 "A victory at Castillon will crush the English pretensions in France forever."
202607 "Should I die in this battle, I die for the Maid of Orléans. I die as a patriot of France."
202651 "A century of English toil, blood, and victories was reversed in a little over a year by a teenage girl. The Hundred Years' War has ended."
202652 "Even more importantly, Joan's acts ignited a sense of French nationalism. Peasants and nobles alike no longer belong to lords and kings, but to France herself."
202653 "We will not let Joan be forgotten.  Already, statues and stained glass portraits have been commissioned in hundreds of towns and cities throughout France."
202654 "Her verdict of guilt was rightfully reversed, and I expect that Joan of Arc will soon be beatified as a saint."
202655 "Sometimes the outcome of history is determined by strength of arms, other times by happenstance."
202656 "But in fifteenth century France, history was determined by the will of a young girl..."
202657 "...the only person in history to command the armies of an entire nation at the age of seventeen."


// 03 - Saladin

203101 "Egypt. A month since I entered the Holy Land..."
203102 "I was in a foreign land. And I was dying."
203103 "I wandered the cold desert for four nights before the horse archers found me. I had abandoned my mount to the vultures and my armor to the heat of day. For a knight, I was not much of a threat to them."
203104 "I thought these men were Turks, come to toy with their prey. But when I could distinguish the riders from the blur of the mirage I saw that they were Saracens, the rulers of the Middle East. I had ridden to the Holy Land with the Crusaders from France and Normandy, so I was by all rights the Saracens' enemy."
203105 "Yet they gave me water and a spindly horse and led me back to their leader."
203106 "And that was how I met Saladin. The paintings in Europe show Saladin as a demonic barbarian. Yet he is more chivalrous than any knight I'd met before, and prefers the palaces of Damascus to slaughtering Normans in the desert. I had not expected hospitality from Saracens...we Normans execute any armed Arab we capture."
203107 "But Saladin left me free to explore his camp. Perhaps he wants an objective observer to chronicle the prodigious bloodshed ahead."
203108 "Saladin's army is heading south to Egypt to reinforce Cairo. Egypt is a tempting prize for the Crusaders. She is fabulously wealthy, yet governed by an ineffectual fool. Before my capture, I was en route to join in the Crusaders' assault on Egypt."
203109 "It is a bitter irony that now I shall view the contest from the enemy camp. So it was that I found myself less than a hundred miles from the Dead Sea, in the company of my enemies."
203151 "The Franks are dispersed, and the Egyptian army broken. Saladin has taken his place as governor of the Nile. Any European king would seize this opportunity to eliminate his political enemies. Saladin however, allowed any Egyptian opposed to his rule to leave the city unharmed."
203152 "Saladin has set out to win over the population. In Cairo, he built mosques and palaces, universities and hospitals. My own countrymen, the sons of Europe, showed naught but treachery, while the Saracens work to dignify their civilization. It is a troubling turn of events and I have difficulty sleeping."

203201 "The Holy City of Medina. Year fifteen of my capture..."
203202 "Volumes have I filled with my fatigued writings. Lord Saladin reads them only rarely. He speaks of greater events yet to come."
203203 "The political boundaries in this endless desert have shifted as a result of three Crusades. Four Crusader states now exist in the Holy Land."
203204 "After the Saracen victory in Egypt, the Crusader leaders realized that Saladin was worthy of their concern. They were quick to suggest a treaty."
203205 "I hoped that with peace at last upon us, I would be returned to my own folk, but this peace, so short-lived, is already broken."
203206 "And it is not Saracen, but Crusader that has violated his word of honor. Reynald de Chatillon, a wicked French knight, has been raiding Arab territory in defiance of the treaty."
203207 "He attacks trade caravans, and his pirate ships threaten the Saracen holy cities of Medina and Mecca. Saladin, in his fury, has sworn to kill Reynald with his own hands."
203251 "Although I am still prisoner, Saladin and his generals dine with me. Over meals we discuss mathematics and astronomy. I never imagined a race of desert folk could be so wise."
203252 "Baghdad, the Saracen capital, is the most civilized city in the world, with free hospitals, public baths, a postal service, and banks with branches as far away as China."
203253 "But as we eat, talk inevitably turns to war. Reynald's pirate vessels now rot at the bottom of the Red Sea. His raids have stopped. Reynald has escaped, but I suspect Saladin shall neither forgive nor forget."

203301 "Galilee. Year twenty of my capture..."
203302 "Last night we rode into a sandstorm. The men dared not open their mouths to speak. We clung to the necks of horses or camels while waves of sand rose and fell around us."
203303 "The Saracens have pursued a large force of Europeans into the desert. The Crusaders carry with them a relic - a piece of the True Cross. Capturing this artifact will deal a severe blow to the morale of Saladin's Christian foes."
203304 "I asked Saladin why we were here, miles from civilization and water. He said 'to bring crimson death to the blue-eyed enemy.'"
203305 "The huge Crusader army has halted to make its stand beneath the two peaks called the Horns of Hattin. At the Horns is only a single pool of water, and Saladin controls it."
203306 "At night, the Saracens ride out and extravagantly pour out vessels of water into the sand within sight of the thirst-crazed Europeans. It is cruelty worthy of a...Crusader."
203351 "The fighting was fierce - the Crusaders had to conquer or die. Mostly, they died."
203352 "Saladin has treated his prisoners well, providing them with ice water from the mountains and comfortable tents. For the first time in years, I have been able to speak to fellow countrymen. But I am unsure what to say to these...invaders."
203353 "Not all of the prisoners were treated so royally. Reynald de Chatillon was captured here and, fulfilling his vow, Saladin sliced off Reynald's head with his own scimitar. How ironic that it was only after the Crusaders entered their lands that the Saracens were transformed into the people that we set out to destroy."

203401 "Jerusalem. Twenty years have I been with the Saracens..."
203402 "Saladin's target is Jerusalem. The great, ancient city is sacred to Christianity, Judaism, and Islam, and is the virtual capital of the Holy Land. If there can be a victor in this endless conflict, it will be the army that holds Jerusalem."
203403 "To complicate matters, Saladin is determined not to harm the city itself. If a single holy shrine is damaged, the populace might well view Saladin not as a liberator, but as yet another conqueror."
203451 "The last time I entered Jerusalem, as a crusading knight, I waded through the blood of victims. This time, not a building was looted, not a townsperson was injured. Saladin set free nearly every prisoner he took."
203452 "The citizens of Jerusalem proclaimed Saladin as their savior. He offered to free me, but after twenty years in his service I have decided to see this journey to the end."

203501 "Tiberias.  Twenty and a half years of bloodshed..."
203502 "We are far from the ocean, so the Saracens interpret the smell of salt and commotion of seabirds as signs from Heaven."
203503 "I sit near Saladin's tent, watching the butchery below. Saracen horse archers sweep through yet another disorganized mob of European soldiers."
203504 "The great Crusader nations have been reduced to puny city-states. Only Tiberias, Tyre, and Ascalon are still in Crusader hands. Nonetheless, these three cities are well fortified and could withstand any siege."
203505 "Saladin has had many victories on the open desert, but the Crusader castles are unparalleled. If he is victorious now, the Holy Land will belong to the Saracens again. A failure could mean even more decades of carnage."
203551 "Once, I was amazed at the nobility of the Saracen warriors. Only a few years ago they entered battle as gentlemen, bringing with them treasure chests, wine, singing girls, and collections of doves, nightingales, and parrots. No longer."
203552 "In reaction to European hostility and fanaticism, the Saracens have steadily become more resolute...more bloodthirsty. Their love of art is replaced by a love for battle. Now, in answer to the crusade, they have adapted their principle of jihad for warfare."
203553 "The result has been devastating to the Crusaders. The European presence in the Holy Land was finished. Or so everyone believed."

203601 "The city of Acre. Nearly twenty-one years have I ridden with Saladin..."
203602 "When word of the Saracen victory at Jerusalem reached Europe, another crusade was launched. The kings of the three most powerful nations in Europe - England, France, and the Holy Roman Empire - embarked for the Holy Land with thousands of troops."
203603 "Saladin knows that his most dangerous opponent is Richard the Lionheart of England, a brilliant tactician who learned the art of war fighting against his own father."
203604 "He builds colossal fortresses and always fights in the front lines - the ideal of a heroic warrior."
203605 "Richard's army has come ashore near Arce. Much of Saladin's army is trapped in the city, while two monstrous English trebuchets pound at Acre's walls. If Richard can defeat our army here, then he can walk into Jerusalem unopposed."
203606 "Saladin knows that this is the climax of his jihad. All of the Crusader states have fallen. If the Saracens can hold Acre, then the Europeans will be forced to return home."
203607 "If Acre falls, then the centuries-long nightmare of eternal war, raid and counter-raid, begin again. All of Saladin's victories will be for nothing."
203651 "The first year of my freedom..."
203652 "The fighting is over. The fire has gone out of Richard's lust for conquest. The two respected adversaries have begun to speak, finally, of peace."
203653 "War is not gentle with men's health. Richard fell ill with a fever. Because he respected his enemy, Saladin sent Richard fruit and mountain snow to comfort him. Soon enough, Richard boarded a ship headed back to England. The Third Crusade is over."
203654 "The final treaty was signed on September 2, 1192. By its terms, Jerusalem remains in Saracen hands, but Christian pilgrims are to be allowed to visit all the holy places, freely and safely. It seems a fitting compromise to a war that has been fought over religion and land."
203655 "The war is over, but I do not think I shall ever set foot in Normandy again. I want to see the steel foundries in Damascus and the gardens of the Caliph in Baghdad. I have never seen the mighty Krak de Chevaliers, now-fallen fortress of the Knights Hospitaller. The Holy Land has many wondrous sights, and I can spend a lifetime here."
203656 "It is peace in the Holy Land...for the moment. Sadly, in a land so small, home to so many different cultures, birthplace of three of the world's great religions, I suspect that blood may one day stain the sand again."


// 04 - Genghis Khan

204101 "A blue wolf took as his spouse a fallow doe. They settled at the head of the Onon River to raise their offspring. And there were born the Mongols."
204102 "So begins my life's work, 'The Secret History of the Mongols.' I have been selected to compose this epic, because great events are about to take place. We are going to leave Mongolia."
204103 "I have lived always on this frigid, dry, and endless steppe. The tribes here squabble like vultures fighting over the desiccated corpse of a marmot. We fight over limited resources: scarce water, few trees, sparse grass for our herds to graze on."
204104 "A wise and dangerous man named Temujin means to change all this. He says that if the tribal conflict is to end, the Mongols require but two things. First, we need green pastures for our herds. With more to go around, there will be less competition among tribes."
204105 "Second, we are a culture of warriors; we need a common enemy with which to do battle."
204106 "To meet both these needs, Temujin has come up with the most modest of schemes: to unite the tribes and go to war with anyone who stands in our path."
204107 "'How?' we ask him. 'How can nomadic horsemen in felt tents embark on a campaign of world conquest?'"
204108 "Temujin replies that we will fight not as warriors, but as a unified army. We fight not for personal glory, but for the glory of the horde."
204109 "And with those words, the name of Temujin has passed almost into obscurity. His name is replaced with a title: Great Khan. Genghis Khan."
204151 "Nearly all of the Mongol tribes have united under the Great Khan. The chieftains of those tribes reluctant to join were boiled alive."
204152 "Each day new faces have taken up the bow; unfamiliar hands hold the nine bands of yak hair that has become Genghis' standard. There are more men and horses gathered in the camp than I ever knew existed."
204153 "Horse archers and lancers, men in leather cuirass and silk armor, all lift their heads upward to the platform from where Genghis speaks. The Great Khan calls himself the punishment of God. Men smile like hungry wolves. It is dawn of the first day of the Mongol Empire."

204201 "Winter has come to the steppes. The earth is frozen hard as bone, and the only movement is the steam rising from the nostrils of men and horses. Only the promise of battle brings warmth."
204202 "Nearly all of the tribes in Mongolia now answer to Genghis Khan. But with success, comes enemies. A man named Kushluk has challenged Genghis' right to rule. Kushluk sows discord among the Kara-Khitai Khanate and means to have himself proclaimed as a rival khan."
204203 "Genghis cannot allow these transgressions to go unpunished. He needs to set an example. So we ride west, to find and slay Kushluk. If the Kara-Khitai shelter him, then their lives are forfeit as well."
204251 "Genghis Khan knows that there are weapons aside from the lance and bow. He is a master of mental warfare. Just as he has made an example of Kushluk, he makes examples of enemy lands."
204252 "When first we encounter a new adversary, the Great Khan spares no one. We ride to the closest town, slay every living thing, burn down the city, sow the fields with salt, and make a mountain of enemy skulls."
204253 "After that, the other towns are quick to send forth their emissaries, eager to placate the ravenous Mongol hordes."

204301 "Now all of Mongolia is in the grasp of Genghis Khan. Beyond are two vast empires: China to the east and Persia to the west. Persia is the sensible next choice of battle since it separates us from the rich forage pastures in Europe."
204302 "But first, Genghis Khan has another score to settle."
204303 "After witnessing the power of our cavalry in action, the Chinese spoke of nothing but peace. They even promised support for our campaign westward."
204304 "But now that we have turned away from China, they have decided not to deliver the men and arms they promised Genghis."
204305 "It is time for another demonstration. Persia can wait as the horde wheels east once more, and we prepare to march into China, the largest, most advanced empire in the world."
204351 "It was...a glorious slaughter. For years, visitors to China will be astounded by the mountain of human and horse skeletons that we have erected."
204352 "Genghis' horde has gained one huge advantage by this invasion of China: technology. We now possess the knowledge and equipment to allow us to make siege weapons."
204353 "We will crack open the Persian and European castles to reach the softer parts within."
204354 "Genghis is pleased with our progress and with the legacy he leaves behind. His mother once ate wild onions and rodents to keep from starving. But the children and grandchildren of Genghis will eat off plates of Persian gold."

204401 "Sleep in the saddle. Drink the rain. Eat nothing but dried meat, dried milk, and horse blood. Such is the life of a Mongol at war."
204402 "At night we are rewarded with fermented yak's milk and the promise of Persian treasures."
204403 "Driven on by the words of the Great Khan we have crossed miles of the Asian continent at full gallop."
204404 "Before us lies the vast empire of Persia."
204405 "The Khwarazm Shah will be given one chance to submit, and then his cities will be pulled down, brick by brick. But not all of us head into Persia."
204406 "Genghis has sent Subotai Ba'atur of the Reindeer People north into Russia. The Russian principalities are disorganized, and Genghis hopes that Subotai can break them one by one. Then the horde will rule all of Asia."
204451 "The Persian army numbered nearly half a million men, but was beaten by a Mongol army less than half that size. The governors of outlying cities were executed by pouring molten silver into their eyes and throats."
204452 "The capital city of Samarkand, which was expected to withstand our siege for a year, fell in five days. Separate mountains were made of the skulls of men, women, children, horses, dogs, and cats."
204453 "We roamed the streets in wonder at the opulence of the Persians, drinking at their fountains and gorging ourselves on sherbet and tropical fruit. For a man born in a tent, it seemed as if Genghis Khan had torn open the gates to Heaven itself."
204454 "Russia and Mesopotamia were now ours to command. The empire now stretched over seven thousand miles from the Pacific Ocean to the Black Sea. We were about to enter Europe when tragedy struck."

204501 "Old wolves do not die gracefully. Warriors their whole lives, they do not know how to live when they grow old and their fangs fall out. Such it is with Mongols as well. Genghis Khan was now eighty years old."
204502 "On the night when we knew our glorious conquest was about to end, Genghis summoned his sons to his tent."
204503 "They found their father shivering before a fire, delirious with pain. 'My descendants will wear gold,' he said, 'they will eat the finest meals and ride the finest horses...and forget to whom they owe it all. A deed is not glorious until it is finished.'"
204504 "And he refused to die until Ogedei, his third son, promised to continue the war."
204505 "Ogedei emerged from the tent, carrying his father's bow, and declared:"
204506 "'This storm is not yet finished, I hear the sound of lightning, and it strikes in Poland.'"
204507 "The church bells rang in Europe when they saw our horde pouring out of the mountains. The armies of Bohemia and Germany hastened to Poland's defense."
204508 "To them, our army might have been from the underworld itself, still commanded by the shade of the Great Khan."
204551 "European knights fight as individuals, but Mongols fight as part of a united army. Laden down with armor, the Polish and Germans could not catch our quick-footed horses."
204552 "Time and again, we fired flaming arrows at them, then retreated out of range. When the enemy cavalry pursued, we would lead them into an ambush."
204553 "The ambush was always announced by the naqara, a huge drum carried into battle on a camel. A hundred times a hundred times has the naqara sounded on this day."
204554 "We were ordered to cut off an ear of every victim. Nine large sacks of ears were sent back to Ogedei Khan."

204601 "Only one power stands in our way. France and the kingdoms beyond are beaten from decades of crusades. If we break Eastern Europe, then it is likely that all of Western Europe will surrender. But, to break the East, we must defeat Hungary."
204602 "Hungary possesses the most formidable cavalry in all of Europe. They have not only the strength of European armor, but their horses are cousins to our own, having drifted in from across the Russian steppes."
204603 "The Sajo River that separates us from the army of Hungary is frozen, so we will be unable to deploy boats. Instead, the battle will be won or lost over who controls the bridge."
204604 "Subotai is coming with reinforcements. If we can survive the charge of the Hungarian knights until Subotai arrives, then we can hope to take the bridge."
204605 "Much rests on this simple bridge. If we capture the Sajo crossing, we capture Hungary. If Hungary falls, so falls Europe. With Europe and Asia under Mongol control, our conquest of the world will be complete and final."
204651 "Nothing stands between us and the Atlantic Ocean. The Mongol Empire comprises two whole continents; Europe and Asia belong to the hordes."
204652 "Every place we have entered has changed forever with our passing. Russia, once filled with quarreling city-states, much like the old Mongol tribes, will forever be melded into a single, gigantic empire."
204653 "Genghis Khan forged the largest empire ever created in the life of one man. His body was carried back to the River Onon, where the legendary Blue Wolf and Fallow Doe once lived. He was buried in the ground, and a thousand horsemen rode over the site to disguise it. Genghis Khan's final resting place was devoured by the steppes."
204654 "My people cherish the legend that their great ruler will one day return to lead his horsemen to another bloody victory."


// 05 - Barbarossa

205101 "So you have come to hear the tale of Frederick Barbarossa?  Better order us another round. Maybe three. You see ... it is a great tale. But then again, everything about the man was great."
205102 "Barbarossa was a man of great appetites ... great ambitions ... and a great, red beard. But the question - the question you want to know - is: Was that enough? Is the will of one man enough to forge an empire?"
205103 "For there was no Holy Roman Empire at that time, only a gaggle of quarrelling city-states. These dubiously loyal princedoms were more interested in a loose confederation than a unified empire."
205104 "But Barbarossa, he believed that he was the emperor by will of God, and he intended to bring the Holy Roman Empire back to its former glory. If that meant crushing all of the German princes, well, so be it."
205151 "They have called Barbarossa the scourge of Europe. But he was as skilled a diplomat as he was a warrior."
205152 "He united the German principalities with more than just the sword. He established a set of legal codes known as the Land Peaces. He helped the hungry by fixing an official price for grain after every harvest. The provinces of Germany quickly became the wealthiest and most powerful in Europe."
205153 "The Holy Roman Empire was so successful, in fact, that it quickly became strong enough to expand."

205201 "The empire was in full bloom, and her population was rapidly growing. The people felled forests, drained marshlands, and reclaimed land from the sea itself."
205202 "This newfound prosperity made expansion too tempting to resist. Eager to test his military might, Barbarossa set his sights east towards the Kingdom of Poland."
205203 "To assist in his invasion, Barbarossa called up one of his mightiest vassals, Henry the Lion.  Henry was a powerful prince of Saxony, and his decadent palaces outshone the emperor's own."
205204 "While he swore fealty to Barbarossa, some questioned whether Henry the Lion did not want the Empire for his own."
205205 "By ordering Henry the Lion to aid in the subjugation of Poland, Barbarossa meant to test his oath of allegiance once and for all."
205251 "Henry expected to be drawn and quartered, the usual fate of traitors in those times. But Barbarossa recognized the potential for a strong ally and officially forgave him, provided that Henry the Lion would swear to support Barbarossa from now on."
205252 "Amazingly, Henry agreed."
205253 "The Germans were unified, and Henry the Lion was pacified. But the Holy Roman Empire was not complete. Harkening back to Charlemagne, the empire claimed ownership of Italy, and especially Rome."

205301 "In Rome, the pope firmly believed that it was the church, not the emperor, who was the ultimate authority for the empire. Barbarossa could not convince the pope to see things his way, so he appointed his own pope."
205302 "This too was not enough, for pope and antipope promptly excommunicated each other."
205303 "In the end, Barbarossa had to resort again to politics at the point of a lance. If the pope would not listen to reason, then perhaps he would concede with two thousand German knights pouring down the Italian peninsula."
205304 "The greatest of the northern cities, the virtual capital of Lombardy, was Milan. The lords of Milan were as proud as they were belligerent."
205305 "Barbarossa was determined to raze Milan to the ground as a warning to all the Italian city-states, and particularly the pope in Rome. The message was clear: He, Frederick Barbarossa, was the one and true Holy Roman Emperor."
205351 "Barbarossa was not kind to the Milanese. In response to one attempt at negotiations during the siege, he sent six Italians marching back to the city."
205352 "Five had been blinded, but the sixth only had his nose cut off so that he could lead the other five."
205353 "Northern Italy had been mercilessly conquered and placed under Imperial governance. But Italy would not submit. If anything, the destruction of Milan made the Italian cities even more incensed at their would-be emperor."

205401 "As long as Barbarossa's knights were present, peace endured. But the emperor could not be everywhere at once. Whenever he went to Italy, Germany would flare up, and when Barbarossa returned to Germany, the Italians began plotting again."
205402 "Milan had fallen, but the remainder of the Italian cities joined together in a confederation known as the Lombard League, for the purpose of defeating Barbarossa."
205403 "If Barbarossa intended to make Italy part of the Holy Roman Empire, he would have to conquer the Lombard League city by city."
205404 "But Barbarossa still had a secret weapon: Henry the Lion and his seasoned troops."
205451 "Henry the Lion was immediately banished to England. Separated from his wealth and army, there was little more he could do to plague Barbarossa."
205452 "After six campaigns down to Italy, Barbarossa was weary of crossing the Alps."
205453 "The fighting ended with the signing of the Treaty of Constance, which said effectively that the emperor and the pope were equals."
205454 "It was a tenuous peace, and one that seemed unlikely to endure, when suddenly the pope died."
205455 "The new pope was less interested in squabbling with the emperor, than he was in events down south. You see, the Europeans were being driven out of the Holy Land. It was time for another Crusade."

205501 "The Holy Roman Empire was complete and, for the moment, both Germany and Italy swore fealty to Barbarossa. Alas, the peace was not to endure."
205502 "The Crusader states in Palestine were crumbling. A Saracen king named Saladin had evicted virtually every Crusader from their castle. The Pope called for a new Crusade, before the Holy Land became Saracen once again."
205503 "Remarkably, Barbarossa agreed to undertake this new Crusade for the pope he had fought so hard against. King Philip of France and England's Richard the Lionhearted had already boarded ships bound for the Middle East."
205504 "But Barbarossa's army was the largest by far, and there wasn't a fleet in Europe that could transport it."
205505 "The emperor would have to march overland, to Constantinople and through the land of the Turks to reach the rendezvous in Jerusalem."
205506 "Constantinople was the capital of the Byzantine Empire and one of the most glorious cities on the globe. Barbarossa's army would be able to rest and resupply in Constantinople before it began the great march."
205551 "Barbarossa's weary army had marched for hundreds of miles through the cracked mountains in the heat of July. So when it stumbled upon the Göksu River, the men were astonished and grateful. Barbarossa himself could not resist plunging into the cold water without even pausing to remove his armor."
205552 "To the disbelief of the surviving troops, Barbarossa drowned."
205553 "Some said the emperor could not swim in his plate armor. Others believed the sixty-seven-year-old heart had finally given out. Regardless of the exact cause of death, Barbarossa's Crusade ended there, on June 10, 1190. The Holy Roman Emperor was gone."

205601 "Barbarossa's soldiers were devastated. Several knights committed suicide. Others converted and joined the Saracens, so convinced were they that God Himself had deserted them."
205602 "However, a handful of knights were not yet willing to board a ship bound for Europe."
205603 "The body of mighty Barbarossa was fished out of the river, pickled in vinegar, and sealed in a barrel. The army of the Holy Roman Empire would not be joining in the Crusade."
205604 "Yet there was still a chance for a small victory. The surviving knights vowed to take Barbarossa's body on to Jerusalem. Even in death, the emperor would keep his promise!"
205651 "There is a legend concerning every great king, from Arthur on through Barbarossa, that says the king will return someday when his country needs him. Myths and legends about the sleeping emperor were passed down in German folktales. The Holy Roman Empire did not endure."
205652 "She fell back into a patchwork of tiny city-states. Some would say Barbarossa's rule was a failure."
205653 "But is it not a greater testament to the man that it was the force of his will alone that held the empire together?"
205654 "And what of Henry the Lion?  With Barbarossa gone, there was nothing stopping him from returning to the Holy Roman Empire."
205655 "But I am an old man now. What harm could I possibly do?"


// 06 - Attila

206101 "A severed head on a pike seemed such a grisly trophy to be displayed in the chapel at Châlons.  And yet it took me weeks before I got up the nerve to ask Father Armand why he kept it."
206102 "The ancient priest stared out the window for a long time, recalling days gone by.  'I was there,' he said finally.  'At the Battle of the Catalaunian Fields...fighting alongside Aetius and Theodoric the Goth.'  I knew there had been a battle here, decades ago.  Peasants still overturn skeletons and broken shields with their plows from time to time."
206103 "'Who was it, Father?'  I asked him.  'Who were you fighting?'  He turned back to regard me, paralyzing me with his old-man's stare.  'Attila the Hun,' he said.  And then he told me the story."
206104 "The Huns rode out from the wilderness sometime in the 370s, eager to feast on a Roman Empire weak from internal corruption and the expansion of other barbarian tribes."
206105 "It was the Huns who drove many of these other barbarians before them.  They were terrifying warriors from the steppes of Asia, their bodies disfigured from ritual scarring, their legs deformed from a near lifetime in the saddle."
206106 "Despite their fearsome aspect, the Huns might have been little more than raiders, had it not been for the leadership of Attila. He called himself the Scourge of God.  Attila and his brother Bleda led the Huns not just to raid, but to devastate Scythia and Persia."
206151 "I asked Father Armand more about this legendary Attila the Hun, whom the stories always treat as more of a monster than a man."
206152 "'He was a man,' the priest said, 'but he did not look like the Romans, nor did he worship the Roman god.  That was the cause of all that was to follow.'  Father Armand shivered as if from the cold breeze that blew in from the chapel's open windows."
206153 "Kingship among the barbarians was not by divine right or lineage, but by who had the strongest will.  Attila was the strongest of the Huns, and he reinforced his position by brandishing a rusty old blade and proclaiming it to be the Sword of Mars, the old Roman god of war. Attila had a custom of fiercely rolling his eyes, as if he wished to enjoy the terror that he inspired...'"
206154 "He had a power over other men, so that many chose to join him.  Many foreigners joined his council, Scythians and Burgundians and Goths. It was not uncommon for Romans to do so as well - several decades prior, the son of a prominent Roman family  had been sent to the Huns as a hostage to ensure peace.  The name of this boy was Flavius Aetius, a name not soon to be forgotten.'"

206201 "Now that the memories had stirred, Father Armand seemed eager to tell his tale.  He explained how the Huns, like the other barbarians, had a style of warfare dramatically different from the ancient Romans or my own Franks."
206202 "The Huns would charge as one group, often firing arrows as they came, and then suddenly retreat again.  For the nations of Europe, who were used to forming up lines and columns and even issuing challenges for personal combat, this was an aberration.  They were unable to comprehend warfare in this manner."
206203 "Barbarians did not conquer lands.  They did not try and hold and colonize the cities they attacked.  Instead, they ravaged and pillaged, and took their loot back to their camps."
206204 "By that time, there were two Roman Empires, the government having decided that the Roman lands were simply too vast for one city to manage effectively.  Attila and the Huns began a series of raids into the Eastern Empire."
206251 "The Roman city of Naissus was erased from the earth.  The Huns so devastated the place that when the Roman ambassadors passed through to meet with Attila, they had to camp outside the city on the river. The riverbanks were covered with human bones, and the stench of death was so great that no one could enter the city. Many cities of Europe would soon suffer the same fate."
206252 "The ambassadors that the Romans sent to Attila concealed an assassination attempt."
206253 "Somehow, Attila knew of the attempt on his life, and sent the terrified assassin back to his emperor, with the gold he had been paid to do the deed in a sack tied to his neck."
206254 "Following such a demonstration, the Huns had no difficulty convincing the Eastern Roman Empire to start paying them tribute, protection money to stave off the inevitable Hun invasion."

206301 "By this time, the Romans had considerable experience dealing with barbarians.  They could civilize the raiders to some extent by offering them otherwise useless land on the Roman borders as a token tribute.  Before Attila, this tactic seemed to be working on the Huns, who settled in the Danube River valley."
206302 "All that changed when Attila seized command.  He was much more aggressive and unpredictable than the previous Hunnic kings.  He demanded that the tributes from Rome be increased and when the Romans refused, Attila made war on the Eastern Roman Empire."
206303 "He marched on the great city of Constantinople, whose double walls had never fallen."
206304 "Attila was done with raiding.  Now the Huns advanced slowly, eradicating everything in their path.  The Romans would reinstate the tribute, or they would be destroyed."
206351 "'Who was this man?' I asked, 'to threaten the Roman emperor?'"
206352 "Titles such as 'Emperor' meant nothing to the Huns.  Attila was not an appointed ruler, only the strongest among the Huns.  The amenities of his 'office' meant nothing to him.  While his chieftains and council ate off of silver plates, Attila's own plate and goblet were hewn from simple wood.  His Scythian guards had jewels on their sword hilts and their cloaks were clasped with gold, but Attila showed no such affectations."
206353 "He was interested only in conquest.  Some said that he was trying to build a legacy to rival that of Alexander the Great.  All of the barbarians wanted to possess Rome, as if it would buy them instant legitimacy as a world-spanning empire.  Unlike most of the other barbarians, however, Attila was actually going to get his chance."

206401 "The Western Roman emperor had a sister named Honoria, who after weary years of confinement to her parlor, made the preposterous decision to send a letter to Attila the Hun.  She asked him to marry her.  One suspects Honoria did not know what she was getting into."
206402 "Attila was plentifully supplied with wives, but he immediately saw the advantage that such a union could put him in.  Suddenly, his plans changed.  He would not invade the Eastern Roman Empire at Constantinople, but the Western Empire, at Rome.  Indeed, he claimed half of the Western Empire as his dowry."
206403 "Attila sent the Huns to march across the Rhine River, and made alliances with the other barbarian chieftains.  Some, namely the Burgundians and Ostrogoths, joined the Hunnic confederation, while others, such as the Visigoths, sought to seek Roman favor by opposing the Huns."
206404 "When Attila entered the Roman province of Gaul, he could claim that he merely sought by force what was his by right of betrothal to Honoria."
206451 "The old priest hung his head as he related what happened next, and I could tell the weight of the memories caused him great sorrow."
206452 "Attila would stop at nothing until he reached his fiancée, Honoria, and his goal of ruling the Roman Empire.  The ravaging of Gaul was unprecedented."
206453 "People were tortured, their bodies torn asunder by wild horses, or their bones crushed under the weight of rolling wagons.  Their unburied limbs were abandoned on the public roads as prey to dogs."
206454 "Heads on stakes stretched from Gaul clear back to the Danube River, from whence the Huns had come.  They lay siege to Orléans, for Attila had learned much of siegecraft since he had faced the walls of Constantinople."
206455 "But as the Huns set to their fell task, a great cloud of dust appeared on the horizon.  Aetius and the Roman army had come."

206501 "'And now,' said Father Armand, 'is where I entered the story.'"
206502 "The battle between Hun and Roman was fought at the end of June, 451.  The Romans were commanded by Aetius, a brilliant and celebrated general who had been held hostage by the Huns when he was a boy.  Aetius knew Attila and he knew the Hunnic ways.  Since he had returned to the Western Empire, Aetius had done more than any man to keep Rome alive throughout the period of barbarian invasions."
206503 "His army was not large enough to face Attila alone, so Aetius convinced tribes of the Alans and Visigoths to ally with him.  Even though these dubious allies had a common hatred of the Huns, it was still a remarkable achievement on Aetius' part to have drawn them into an effective military relationship."
206504 "The Huns were eager for battle.  Attila's shamans looked at the entrails of cattle and the color of sheep bones, and prophesized that the Huns would meet defeat on the Catalaunian Fields.  However, they also foresaw that the commander of the opposing force would be killed."
206505 "Attila must have thought this a fair trade, because he brought battle to Aetius and the Goths."
206506 "Before blood was drawn, Attila stood before his assembled troops clutching the sword of Mars in his fist.  He told them, 'It is a right of nature to glut the soul with vengeance.  I shall hurl the first spear at the foe.  If any man can stand at rest while Attila fights, he is a dead man.'"
206551 "It was a catastrophic battle, one of the largest and greatest the world has ever seen.  The stream was turned to a torrent by the rushing of blood.  I pity those that were forced to slake their thirst from it.  'Cadavera vero innumera', the Romans said afterwards.  'Truly countless bodies.'  Perhaps 300,000 men were left dead on the Catalaunian Fields.  It is said the ghosts of those killed continued to fight for several days."
206552 "I passed within inches of the fell Hun king as he stalked the battlefield, trying to determine which of his chieftains and allies yet lived.  When he found me, huddled beneath my shield, I made my peace with God.  But Attila did not seek my decapitation.  He saw that I was a holy man, and ordered me to join his retinue of foreign advisors.  'That is how you know so much of the Huns,' I offered."
206553 "The priest nodded. Despite the carnage, the outcome of the legendary battle was unclear.  Attila had lost much of his cavalry, but the Roman army would never recover from its losses. For a time, no one knew if the Hunnic king would continue to pursue the hand of Honoria.  'But what of the prophecy?'  I asked.  'Did Aetius die on the battlefield?'"
206554 "'Nay.  It was Theodoric the Goth, not Aetius, who died and fulfilled the prophecy.  Aetius knew that if he utterly destroyed the Huns, then the Visigoths would have no need for a Roman alliance and Rome would face yet another barbarian threat."
206555 "And so, Aetius retired from military life, hoping that the outcome of the Catalaunian Fields would leave the Huns and Goths in a stalemate. He hoped he had done enough to save his empire.  He had not."

206601 "As far as Attila was concerned, Honoria was waiting with open arms in Rome.  The very next year, partially recovered from his losses, Attila turned his attention to Italy."
206602 "The Huns crossed the Alps and moved down the Italian peninsula, launching another great invasion that terrorized the inhabitants of the Western Roman Empire.  He meant to take Rome, and crown himself emperor."
206603 "This was not the Rome of Caesar, mind you, but a withering Rome, beaten from earthquakes and barbarian wars.  And this time, there was no General Aetius to hold off the Huns' savagery."
206651 "The city of Aquileia at the tip of the Adriatic was wiped off the face of the earth. The fugitives from that pitiful city took refuge among the islands, marshes, and lagoons at the head of the Adriatic Sea and there founded the town of Venetia, or Venice."
206652 "'But what of the Pope?' I asked."
206653 "No one knows what Saint Leo said to the Hunnic king, but that very day Attila turned his army around and started back for the Hun lands on the Danube."
206654 "Attila the Hun died shortly thereafter.  Since he had failed to claim Rome, he could not have Honoria, and instead brought another wife into his harem."
206655 "On his wedding night, Attila suffered a nosebleed and choked to death.  For a man who had boasted that 'where my horse has trodden, no grass grows' it was a curiously anti-climactic death."
206656 "The Hunnic warriors cut their hair and gashed their faces, so that the king should be lamented, not by tears of maidens, but by the blood of warriors.  Attila's bloody reign of conquest lasted nineteen long years."
206657 "Father Armand was silent for a long time.  He glanced over at the head on a stake.  'A Hunnic trophy,' he said.  'I think the man was a Visigoth.  He died at the Battle of the Catalaunian Fields.  I keep it here so that I may see it every day and remember.'  'Remember what, Father?' I asked him."
206658 "The scent of a burning village.  The sound of butchery.  The way peasants would flee before the Hun riders.  The way we would ride them down.  The way it felt to conquer alongside Attila and the Huns."
206659 "He leaned so close I could feel his breath.  'Sometimes..."
206660 "...I miss it.'"


// 07 - El Cid

207101 "Enough.  You have troubled me for three blocks now, stranger.  If you agree to cease this dogged pursuit and leave me to my lamentations, then I will answer your relentless questions.  I will tell you why a dead man rides through the streets of Valencia."
207102 "You see that castle on the hill?  That is the home of Rodrigo Díaz, whom Moor and Christian alike call 'El Cid'.  It is from the Arabic 'sayyid' which means 'lord'.  He is the greatest man who ever lived."
207103 "The Cid was a knight and loyal vassal of one of the old kings of Spain."
207104 "When the old king died, his kingdom was partitioned between his surviving sons, Sancho and Alfonso.  King Sancho ruled Castile, a windswept barren land named for its many border castles.  The Cid continued to serve Castile, and its new king, as was his duty.  The sly king Alfonso ruled Léon, but openly plotted to become king of all of Christian Spain.  There was soon open warfare between Castile and Léon."
207105 "The struggle climaxed at the battle of Golpejera, where the Cid attempted to capture the wicked Alfonso."
207151 "Although the Cid defeated Alfonso's army in combat, the sly king knew there were more devious ways to win a war.  Alfonso lured his brother, King Sancho, to a secret conference below the city walls of Zamora, and had him assassinated in the night."
207152 "With the death of his brother, Alfonso became king of both Leon and Castile--the most powerful king in Christian Spain."
207153 "The Cid could not trust King Alfonso, yet he was sworn to serve his king, and that man was now Alfonso."
207154 "The Cid forced King Alfonso to swear an oath upon sacred relics that he had nothing to do with Sancho's death.  Before his army and his court, a nervous Alfonso did make this declaration.  In so doing, the Cid helped to cement Alfonso's claim as king in the hearts of the people, for they so trusted the Cid."
207155 "King Alfonso did not recognize that the Cid had done him a service.  Instead, Alfonso held a grudge against the man who was the greatest of his knights for ever doubting him.  Alfonso also was jealous and suspicious of the Cid's popularity with the soldiers and the common man.  He sent the Cid into dangerous battle again and again, but always the Cid emerged victorious."

207201 "How do I know so much of my Cid, Rodrigo Díaz?  I am Ximena of Asturias, and I am the Dona of this castle.  Rodrigo and I were married in Castile in 1075.  Those were among the happiest days of my life, at least when my husband was not being sent to do battle against the Moors."
207202 "Far to the east, in the Holy Land, they speak of only one Muslim expansion - that of the Seljuk Turks.  But here, in Spain, we speak of another - the Moors.  The Moors ruled southern Spain for so long that Christian and Muslim often lived side by side with little animosity.  Such was the case in the city of Toledo, which was in Moorish lands, but inhabited by Christians as well."
207203 "A political assassination had plunged the city of Toledo into a civil war.  Seeing a chance to expand his empire, King Alfonso struck at Toledo under the pretense of restoring order."
207204 "He ordered the Cid to command the army, though one must wonder if once again he was intentionally putting the Cid in harm's way."
207251 "Once again, the Cid emerged victorious, and delivered the city to King Alfonso.  Moor and Christian alike shouted his name from the city walls, and called him El Cid Campeador - my lord, the conqueror.  After nearly 400 years of Moorish rule, the city of Toledo was ruled by a Christian king."
207252 "But still Alfonso was not satisfied!  He accused the Cid of seeking personal glory at the expense of the crown.  When he heard the peasants shouting the name of the Cid instead of Alfonso's own name, he became even more angered.  I knew then that our contented lives in Castile were about to end."

207301 "King Alfonso sent his most loyal and able servant, Rodrigo Díaz, the Cid, into exile with only his horse, Bavieca.  Myself and our two daughters were left at the monastery in Castile."
207302 "When Rodrigo and I parted, it felt like a nail being torn from its finger.  Rodrigo rode alone into the Castilian winter."
207303 "He was not alone for long.  Everywhere the Cid went, mercenaries and soldiers were eager to follow.  Soon, he had a small army of his own.  But the Cid was not content to wander the wilds of Castile forever."
207304 "He needed a castle and a lord to serve.  This too, he found, in the most unlikely of places."
207351 "Motamid, Lord of Zaragoza, was a gifted leader of men, but like many of the Moors, he was also a poet and artist.  The cultural achievements of the Moors made the rest of Europe seem barbaric in comparison."
207352 "As the Cid parlayed with Lord Motamid in his sumptuous palace, he feasted on meals that came floating down an indoor stream.  Motamid bestowed rich gifts on the Cid, and made him a wealthy man."
207353 "But the Cid, ever the loyal servant of Castile, convinced Motamid to ratify a treaty, making Zaragoza part of Castile."
207354 "The Cid never fought openly against King Alfonso, though he did make enemies with Count Berenguer and other Spanish lords who wanted only tributes of gold from the Moors and were not interested in making alliances with them.  Count Berenguer would remain the Cid's enemy for many years."

207401 "King Alfonso watched with alarm as the combined Christian-Moorish forces of the Cid gained power and prestige.  Finally, he could stand it no longer, and sent his own army against Motamid's Moors at Zaragoza."
207402 "As much as he would have liked to come to the assistance of his friend Motamid, the Cid could not draw steel against King Alfonso, as he was still the Cid's rightful lord."
207403 "Since the Cid could not assist him, Motamid was forced to seek help elsewhere. When he contacted the Almoravid Berbers who lived beyond the sea in Gibraltar, however, he received more than he bargained for."
207404 "These veiled religious zealots waged a continuous jihad across the barren dunes of the Sahara."
207405 "Their leader, the fanatical Yusuf who never showed his face, immediately prepared to cross the ocean into Spain with thousands of men and camels.  King Alfonso's army was certain to crumble beneath this new wave of invaders."
207451 "Alfonso needed only have mentioned that Spain was in jeopardy, and the Cid would have come!  And when the Cid did finally come to his king's aid, the Berbers were crushed, and their leader, Yusuf, was forced to flee back to Africa."
207452 "The Cid bowed to Alfonso, ready to return to his rightful place as the king's champion.  But King Alfonso was angered that the Cid had not arrived sooner and ordered him to return to his exile."
207453 "This time he seized the Cid's wife and children.  Many long years did I rot in the dungeons of Castile."

207501 "The Cid was in exile again, and this time there were no more Moors to welcome him in.  He wandered the bleak rocks of Castile and wondered if his tale was finally at an end."
207502 "And yet, a remarkable thing happened.  Many mercenaries and knights knew of the tales of the Cid, and were eager to follow him, even without a castle.  As the Cid wandered further south, more men, Christian and Muslim, joined his army.  Eventually, the Cid had a large enough force to carve out a fiefdom of his own."
207503 "King Alfonso had set his sights on beautiful Valencia, the jewel of the Moorish coast.  But the Cid was closer and could get there sooner."
207504 "If he conquered Valencia, the Cid would have protection not only from the machinations of Alfonso, but also a bulwark against the inevitable second invasion of Yusuf and the Berbers."
207505 "Events would have unfolded simply then, had not our old enemy, Count Berenguer of Barcelona, picked that moment to strike back at the Cid."
207551 "How abundant the orange groves and olive trees seemed to the conquerors who had come from bleak Castile.  Valencia was a tropical paradise, complete with palm trees, a silk market and abundant fish and waterfowl."
207552 "After the Cid had secured the castle and saw to the defenses of the city, he sent for me and the children.  Our reunion took place on the highest tower of the castle, before a sea that consumed the entire horizon."
207553 "We turned Valencia into our own kingdom, uniting eight-thousand Christian and twenty-thousand Moorish soldiers.  It was the greatest of the Cid's accomplishments to date."
207554 "We were far away from the reach of King Alfonso, and Count Berenguer himself was safely locked in Valencia's dungeons.  In time, he would be ransomed, and one of our daughters married to his nephew and heir, to ward against future conflicts."
207555 "If only the tale of the Cid had ended there, beneath the Valencian sunsets.  But it was not to be. Valencia lay right in the path of the advancing horde of the frenzied Yusuf and his Berber warriors."

207601 "We were trapped and alone in our kingdom of Valencia.  The Cid immediately sent out messages for potential allies, but there were few to be found.  The Christian kingdom of Aragon was too far away, and King Alfonso of Castile seemed in no hurry to come to the Cid's defense."
207602 "Even the Cid's old ally, Motamid the Moor, was of no avail.  Yusuf had sent him into exile in the Sahara Desert, where he spent the rest of his sad days composing poetry."
207603 "The Berbers rode around the city for ten days and nights, shrieking and banging their weapons on shields made of hippopotamus hide.  But the Cid comforted his troops, prayed and planned a counterattack."
207604 "And then the unthinkable happened.  During a brilliant surprise attack to capture gold and horses from the Berbers, Rodrigo Díaz, my Cid, was shot by a stray arrow.  The surprise attack became a rout, and the Cid's men barely made it back to the castle with his broken body."
207605 "Rodrigo and I knew he would not last the night.  But we also knew that without their Cid to lead them, the soldiers of Valencia would never have the strength to stand against the Berbers."
207606 "So as he breathed his last breath, I strapped my husband onto his horse, Bavieca, and placed his sword, Tizon, in his hand. Bavieca stood out above the city of Valencia."
207607 "My one hope was that the men would not realize the charade -- realize that their Cid was already dead."
207651 "It was the twilight of Moorish Spain.  The Berber army had been broken and Valencia withstood the siege."
207652 "King Alfonso would not allow us to bury the Cid until he could personally attend the funeral.  When he arrived, he dispelled all thoughts of interring the Cid into the earth."
207653 "Instead, the Cid's body was preserved and placed near the altar of the church, seated on an ivory stool that he had captured from the Moors, clothed in precious silk, and holding his sword, Tizon, in his left hand."
207654 "And who was left to rule in Valencia?  King Alfonso of Castile or Count Berenguer of Barcelona?  No. Valencia is mine."
207655 "It is I, Ximena Díaz who claims rulership of my dead husband's kingdom.  And if the Berbers return to Valencia, it is I whom they shall find commanding the soldiers of Rodrigo Díaz, El Cid Campeador!"


// 08 - Montezuma

208101 "Passed down to you by Cuauhtémoc, Eagle Warrior of Tenochtitlan.  An omen appeared above the forest, the shape of an ear of corn, but blazing like daybreak.  It seemed to bleed fire, drop by drop, like a wound in the sky.  I am a warrior, not a priest, and knew not what to make of such a sign."
208102 "I consulted with the seers and magicians to see if another great war was coming, but they answered only in riddles.  'The gods want more sacrifice,' was their answer.  That was always their answer."
208103 "Much of our empire of rainforests and volcanoes has been conquered in the name of sacrifice.  The magicians tell us that we must make a sacrifice every single day for the sun to continue to rise."
208104 "It took the relay teams two full days to carry my message the two hundred miles to our city of Tenochtitlan.  After two more days, my uncle, Montezuma, emperor of the Aztecs, sent his reply."
208105 "Montezuma's priests foretold that the god Quetzalcoatl might soon return from his long exile.  How else to explain the omen?"
208106 "Montezuma ordered my warriors to increase their efforts to consolidate the rainforest between our lands and those of our enemies. We must establish control over four shrines that are sacred to Quetzalcoatl, the Feathered Serpent."
208107 "Because the Aztec Empire is mighty and constantly expands, we have made many enemies. We must defend these shrines from our enemies in order to prepare for Quetzalcoatl's eventual return."
208151 "When my warriors had captured the shrines and defeated the Xochimilco and Tlatiluco, we made the long journey back to Tenochtitlan, laden with gifts for Emperor Montezuma: jade, feathers, and, of course, prisoners."
208152 "The sheer vastness of our city on the lake seemed staggering after having been in the rainforest for so many days."
208153 "Emperor Montezuma lives in the most sumptuous rooms of the palace with his wives and concubines.  While we spoke, he drank frothing chocolate from a golden cup.  Musicians played their drums and flutes and masked women danced."
208154 "When my uncle, Montezuma, first ascended the great pyramid many years ago to become emperor, there was a great celebration.  Yet now some question his leadership.  He sometimes makes decisions slowly, and rarely does he lead the warriors into combat."
208155 "Montezuma's priests informed us that Quetzalcoatl, the Feathered Serpent, would soon return to Tenochtitlan to reclaim his kingdom.  Since I had helped prepare for his coming, I was given a new obsidian macana and promoted to the rank of Jaguar Warrior.  There was more feasting and dancing that night.  The air was heavy with perfume."
208156 "However, I noticed as I walked down the steps of the emperor's palace that the omen still hung heavily over the lake, spraying sparks over the midnight sky.  So says Cuauhtémoc, Jaguar Warrior of Tenochtitlan."

208201 "Passed down to you by Cuauhtémoc, Jaguar Warrior of Tenochtitlan.  The gods were still uneasy, for another omen appeared that same year.  The temple of the demon Huitzilopochtli burst suddenly into flame, although it was made of stone.  When the people hurried to pour water on the fire, it burned with even greater violence."
208202 "I asked our emperor Montezuma what we needed to do to appease the gods.  His haughty priests made the predictable reply.  The Aztec Empire needed more prisoners.  The sun god, the rain god, and even the Feathered Serpent, Quetzalcoatl, were angry deities that required sacrifice."
208203 "Our city-state of Tenochtitlan is allied with two others, together composing the Triple Alliance.  Montezuma intended for the Triple Alliance to attack our longtime enemies, the Tlaxcala."
208204 "I sent the traditional shield, arrows and cloaks to the Tlaxcala, declaring to them that they would soon be attacked.  Then we marched out into the forests, our jaguar and eagle banners ready to clash with the heron banners of the Tlaxcala."
208205 "Birds in the rainforest canopy took to the sky, eager to be away from the violence that was to come."
208251 "The first messengers to arrive in Tenochtitlan told of mountains or towers that floated on the sea.  Each story told to Montezuma was more fantastic than the last: they could fire stone balls, shooting sparks and raining fire that could crack open weapons."
208252 "Huge deer with no antlers carried these gods on their backs.  Their swords were iron, their bows were iron, their shields were iron, and their clothes were iron.  Surely this was the return of Quetzalcoatl!"
208253 "Montezuma heard these reports with growing alarm, as he shifted nervously on the icpalli, his legless throne.  He ordered expensive gifts to be sent to the new arrivals, in the hopes that Quetzalcoatl would spare Montezuma when the Feathered Serpent came to Tenochtitlan."
208254 "'He has come back,' Montezuma whispered to me.  'He seeks his place on the throne, for that is what he promised when he departed.'  I held my weapons tightly but said nothing.  How could I challenge the word of our emperor?  So says Cuauhtémoc, Jaguar Warrior of Tenochtitlan."

208301 "Passed down to you by Cuauhtémoc, Jaguar Warrior of Tenochtitlan.  Another omen.  The lake around the great city of Tenochtitlan rose and boiled.  It foamed until it washed against the houses of the city, sweeping many of them into the lake."
208302 "I accompanied our dignitaries to meet with the new arrivals.  We journeyed towards the coast, through the lands of our enemies, the Tlaxcala.  When we emerged from the forest, the strangers welcomed us, although they kept their weapons nearby."
208303 "I told them that we were Aztecs, representatives of the great Montezuma.  Their leader said that his people were Spanish and he named himself Cortéz, although he seemed pleased when we referred to him as Quetzalcoatl.  Although their armor and animals seemed otherworldly, they did not seem like gods to me."
208304 "We presented Cortéz gifts of finest cotton and plumes of bird feathers, but he seemed more interested in the gold ornaments.  He asked again and again if there was more gold to be found in Tenochtitlan."
208305 "By now, Cortéz had advanced all the way to the lands of the Tlaxcala.  There was initial warfare made between Tlaxcala and the Spanish.  However, when Cortéz heard stories about the size of Tenochtitlan, and the numbers of our brave Aztec warriors, he suggested that the Spanish and Tlaxcala join forces and attack the Aztecs."
208351 "Although the Aztec warriors fought well that day, my men were frightened by the beasts that the Spanish rode into combat, and by the noise of their exploding weapons.  Although we had survived the attack, I thought it best to withdraw towards Tenochtitlan and share with Emperor Montezuma all that we had learned."
208352 "I do not know if my uncle, Montezuma, was being cowardly or merely trying to preserve us from the wrath of the gods, but he sent more gifts to Cortéz along with an invitation to visit our great city as his personal guest."
208353 "I was there when Montezuma met Cortéz on one of the causeways leading into our great city.  The Spanish had evidently never seen anything like Tenochtitlan, and they stared in wonder at the brightly colored markets and pyramids rising out of a man-made island in the middle of gigantic Lake Texcoco."
208354 "Some of the Spanish soldiers asked whether it was all a dream, the first glimpse of things never heard, seen or dreamed before."
208355 "Montezuma led Cortéz to the top of the Great Pyramid, where he pointed out the various canals and neighborhoods of the city, but Cortéz was mostly interested in gold ornaments, and helped himself to any which he encountered.  I was no longer convinced that this man was Quetzalcoatl.  So says Cuauhtémoc, Jaguar Warrior of Tenochtitlan."

208401 "Passed down to you by Cuauhtémoc, prisoner of Tenochtitlan.  The next omen we did not see, but heard: the voice of a weeping woman who cried in the night that she could not hide her children."
208402 "Indecision plagued Emperor Montezuma.  Was this man Quetzalcoatl, or was he just a man?  As the emperor brooded, the citizens grew restless.  Cortéz kept a close watch on the emperor, and soon Montezuma became a prisoner in his own palace.  Thus did the Spanish take Tenochtitlan without a siege."
208403 "The Spanish collected all of the gold that they could find.  They were not interested in our art or ornaments, but merely melted down the gold for the return to Spain."
208404 "They also outlawed any further sacrifice to the gods.  When the priests protested, they were killed."
208405 "The citizens and warriors of Tenochtitlan were enraged.  We knew, even if our emperor did not, that these men were not gods."
208406 "Riots broke out in the marketplaces and at the palace.  When Montezuma himself appeared on the walls urging the Aztecs to be at peace, the people threw stones at him.  It was time to remove these so-called gods from Tenochtitlan!"
208451 "The Spanish called it la noche triste, which meant 'the night of sorrows' in their language.  At first, the Spanish barricaded themselves in our homes and palaces, but we continuously attacked their quarters."
208452 "With stones, slings and arrows, we drove the Spanish and Tlaxcalans through the streets of Tenochtitlan and across the three bridges and over the walls into Lake Texcoco."
208453 "Thousands died.  Those Spanish that were not killed by macanas or javelins were drowned by the weight of the treasure they refused to leave behind.  Tenochtitlan lay in ruin, but the city was ours again."
208454 "Many brave Aztec warriors died that night as well, including noble Montezuma.  The Spanish claimed that our own people had killed him with thrown stones.  Thus it was a night of sorrows for us as well.  So says Cuauhtémoc, defender of Tenochtitlan."

208501 "Passed down to you by Cuauhtémoc, Emperor of Tenochtitlan.  The death of Montezuma only served to further inflame the fury of my people.  I planned to lead the attack personally against the Spanish.  'That is as it should be, Cuauhtémoc,' the priests told me, 'for you are now our emperor.'"
208502 "I took my place on the icpalli throne and the headdress of the emperor was placed upon my head.  A crown is never a comfortable thing to wear."
208503 "Cortéz had still not made it far from Tenochtitlan, for the Spanish were weighed down with our stolen gold.  As they fled around the shores of the lake, my warriors pursued them in canoes."
208504 "I sent additional warriors by land, for it was obvious now that Cortéz was attempting to flee back to the safety of his allies in Tlaxcala.  We caught up with the Spanish on the north side of Lake Texcoco."
208551 "I hoped that the surviving Spanish on the edge of the lake could see as their captured comrades were dragged up the steps of the great pyramid.  Perhaps they would then understand why we feared the wrath of the Feathered Serpent, Quetzalcoatl.  Perhaps they would know fear as well."
208552 "With the fighting having subsided, there was much work to be done.  Our city had suffered much from the Spanish occupation and the fighting in the streets.  The priests set out to repair the temples, for the Spanish had cast down the idols that we had placed there."
208553 "We began a celebration to give thanks to the gods when a great plague struck Tenochtitlan.  Many of our people became helpless and could only lie on their beds.  Many others died."
208554 "We did not know if the gods were still unhappy with us, or if this was some weapon unleashed by the Spanish.  Regardless, if Cortéz returned, he would find a much weakened city.  I could not let that happen.  So says Cuauhtémoc, Emperor of Tenochtitlan."

208601 "Passed down to you by Cuauhtémoc, Emperor of Tenochtitlan.  The Spanish will return soon.  I had hoped that Cortéz would continue fleeing back from whence he came, but he stopped to regroup at Tlaxcala.  I imagine that he could not stand the thought of returning to Spain while we still had treasuries of gold hidden from him.  Still dreaming of gold and glory, the Spanish pledged themselves to another assault on Tenochtitlan."
208602 "In Tlaxcala, Cortéz constructed many war boats on dry land.  Then he had the crafts broken down and carried through the rain forest, only to be rebuilt on Lake Texcoco."
208603 "He knows that my Aztec warriors can defend the bridges leading into Tenochtitlan, but we are vulnerable from the water."
208604 "I called the warriors to one final battle.  The priests attempted to encourage the troops by calling upon the Aztecs to defend their ancient gods and their glorious city."
208605 "They sent up smoke signals to declare that the Aztecs were ready for war as I climbed the steps of the great temple and sounded the shell trumpet.  Tenochtitlan would be under siege soon, and the brave Aztecs would die before we would see her captured."
208651 "Not so long ago, some five hundred thousand people called Tenochtitlan home.  It is difficult to recall that this smoking ruin was once an endless city.  Yet, we will rebuild.  We created this island upon which our city and temples stand, and we can do it once more."
208652 "The Aztec Empire has endured its greatest challenge.  Yet, the Spanish may return in the future.  I am not certain that there is a place for us in this new world.  I could ask the gods for a hint of the future, but no doubt that would lead to more sacrifice and I think there has been enough death for now.  My people composed a poem to commemorate this great war that we have survived, and yet perhaps still not won:"
208653 "Broken spears lie in the roads. We have torn our hair in our grief.  The houses are roofless now, and their walls are red with blood...so says Cuauhtémoc, Emperor of Tenochtitlan."


// 09-1 - Tours

209101 "It is impossible to imagine the world ending on such a fine fall day. Yet the storm of Muslim horsemen continues to rage throughout Europe, leaving conquered cities and shattered armies stunned in its wake. The lighting-quick strikes of the Muslim horsemen break the city of Bordeaux and then Poitiers, leaving precious little of the Frankish Kingdom to defend."
209102 "Yet Charles Martel gathers the disheartened Frankish army for one last stand at the city of Tours."
209103 "Arabic horses, bred for speed and beauty, begin to splash across the Vienne River. Martel's knights and swordsmen, trudging under the weight of iron mail, struggle to interpose themselves between the Muslims and the city of Tours."
209104 "Carrion birds circle in the air, anticipating the savagery to come.  The rest of Europe watches anxiously, for this is the climax of the Muslim invasion and the last stand of Christian Europe."
209151 "The soul of the Frankish army was its knights, but Charles Martel knew that his cavalry-undisciplined, buried under weight of weapons and armor-could not match the swiftness of the Muslim riders. Therefore, he ordered the knights to dismount and join ranks with the Frankish swordsmen to form a tight shield wall."
209152 "The Muslims had always conquered with swift offensiveness and were not equipped to counter the Franks' defensive strategy. The arrows of the Muslim archers bounced harmlessly off the heavy Frankish armor, and the light Muslim cavalry could not breach the human chain."
209153 "Battered and bleeding, the invaders broke ranks and fled back to the Pyrenees and the protection of Spain. From Charles Martel's Frankish kingdom eventually grew the Holy Roman Empire, making him the founding father of both Germany and France."

// 09-2 - Vinlandsaga

209201 "In the gloom, the longhouse feels empty, but it is filled with the odors of rust, tar, and animal fur, and the snoring of dogs.  It is the man named Erik who speaks, smacking scarred fingers together for emphasis, the steam of his breath mingling with the wood smoke."
209202 "He fills the men's heads with legends of exploration and raiding, of a sea that eats longboats and an undiscovered country ripe for Viking occupation.  He tells the Vikings that they can leave their frigid homeland and sail across the endless Sea of Worms to a new world brimming with wild grain, grapes, and tall trees."
209203 "To the Vikings, he speaks of paradise, and of course the grizzled Norsemen are always eager for adventure.  When he asks for volunteers, men slam their weapons on tables and shout his name in the cold air.  Erik the Red smiles."
209251 "Much of the Viking history is recorded in oral accounts called sagas passed down through generations.  Two of the most famous sagas are reserved for the adventures of Erik the Red and his men, who crossed the mighty sea in tiny ships to forge a new Viking sovereignty."
209252 "Vinland, as the new world was called, was not kind to the Vikings.  Although they lacked the iron weapons of the Norsemen, the native Skraelings were fierce warriors who fought relentlessly to defend their homeland against the Norse invaders."
209253 "The vastness of the North Atlantic cut the Vikings in Newfoundland off from their homeland, and they suffered many long years while trying to establish their new colony."

// 09-3 - Hastings

209301 "Mercenaries and Norman knights look dubiously at the ships that wobble in the black, fog-choked sea.  What man is this Duke William to put so many horses on leaky transports?  William ignores their questioning glances and stares across the channel in the direction of England."
209302 "Edward the Confessor is dead, and now three men claim rulership of England. Harold the Saxon sits on the English throne and even now hastens to fortify his shores against two invasions."
209303 "Harald Hardrada, King of Denmark and Norway, sends Vikings from the north as William invades from the south.  The outcome of this three-way conflict is as murky as the fog that shrouds the English Channel."
209304 "Harold the Saxon's huskarls are professional soldiers, not mercenaries.  William's only chance is to use heavy cavalry. To do so, he must first get all of these horses onto these unreliable boats.  The future of England is about to be decided ..."
209351 "Harold the Saxon's huskarls looked certain to defend the crown for him as they fought the Vikings to a bloody stalemate at Stamford Bridge.  Despite his losses, Harold marched his exhausted troops south to meet William the Conqueror near Hastings."
209352 "William's archers and pikemen were no match for Harold the Saxon's veteran huskarls.  Harold even broke the charge of William's knights.  William himself went down in the fray, and as rumors of his death spread, the Normans turned to flee."
209353 "William was not dead, however, and he rallied his troops by throwing aside his helmet so they could see his clean-shaven face and know that he was alive.  William and his armored knights rode down the huskarls, breaking the Saxon force, and continued their ride all the way to London. William was crowned king on Christmas Day."
209354 "Because his reign eventually ushered England into a position of unprecedented world leadership, the year 1066 became established as the most famous date in English history."

// 09-4 - Manzikert

209401 "Minarets of dust twist upwards as horse hooves strike the fractured earth.  Thousands of Seljuk Turks stream across the Anatolian Plateau to converge on the walled town of Manzikert, which was recently recaptured by the Byzantine army."
209402 "The Byzantines are the heirs of Rome, and their armored cataphracts and legions of disciplined swordsmen can smash aside the light armored Turkish horse archers--provided they can catch them. However, an unlikely turn of events has greatly improved the Turks' chances for victory."
209403 "The Byzantine army is wracked by treachery and deceit from within. One day, a band of mercenaries deserts the Byzantines.  On another, the army's second in command leads a treacherous conspiracy against the commanding general."
209404 "If the Turks can somehow turn the splintering factions against the Byzantine army, they may overcome a better-equipped and better-trained enemy."
209451 "As long as the sun was in the sky, the Byzantine army could fight the Turks back towards their camp.  When dusk settled over Anatolia, however, the Turks could harass the ponderous Byzantine cavalry as it withdrew to Manzikert."
209452 "When they could stand no more of this torment, the Byzantine flanks collapsed into a full rout and the Turkish horse archers pounced for a quick kill."
209453 "The Battle of Manzikert was not lost due to the poor performance of soldiers or commanders, but through Byzantine treachery. Deceit from within the armies disrupted the chain of command, as factions feuding for control of the throne in Constantinople betrayed their armies at the front."
209454 "A much-weakened Byzantium was then forced to call to the rest of the Christian West for help, leading to the Crusades.  The Byzantine Empire lingered for another four centuries, but in only a shadow of its former glory."

// 09-5 - Agincourt

209501 "The rains come again, until there is nothing left of road, wood, or field, nothing in the entire world but mud. The exhausted English soldiers hoist their longbows over their heads, trying to protect the precious yew wood from the water."
209502 "The empty wagons can scarcely roll forward, even though all of the supplies have long been eaten.  Terrifying hoof beats resound from the rear.  The French knights have come."
209503 "The English have been in a slow retreat ever since the debacle at Harfleur, where King Henry the Fifth's glorious siege dragged on and on, costing the lives of 3000 Englishmen."
209504 "Now, Henry has all but abandoned his dream of establishing his hereditary claim to the French crown.  Like his men, he only wants to reach Calais and the ships that will return them home to England."
209505 "On the road back to Calais, the French army overtakes Henry.  Knowing that the English are fatigued, starving, and outnumbered three to one, the French have no interest in negotiation.  The English make their stand on a wooded hilltop."
209506 "The archers plant stakes in the ground to offer some barrier against the deadly French cavalry."
209507 "Henry's only hope is that his lightly-armored infantry prove more nimble than the impetuous French knights, and that the range of his archers can even the odds before the French horses are upon them."
209551 "The Battle of Agincourt is remembered not because it was an inevitable triumph, but because it was an upset.  Outnumbered English longbows were victorious over French knights only because the knights had to charge up a muddy hill through a dense forest."
209552 "The English wore little armor and were able to catch the encumbered French in the middle of their retreat.  A charge by Henry and his surviving cavalry pushed aside the beaten French and opened the road to the coast."
209553 "Despite his victory, Henry did not follow through on his attack, but withdrew to England.  The true winner of the battle was Burgundy, which was able to come to power in a vacuum emptied by both the English and the French."

// 09-6 - Lepanto

209601 "The steady splashing of the oars of 200 ships striking the water drowns out all other sound.  The most powerful fleet ever assembled by Don Juan of Austria and his allies in Venice sails under the burning light of dawn towards a final encounter with the Ottoman Turks."
209602 "The Turkish army has greatly expanded its empire, adding North Africa and Mesopotamia to the Turkish holdings in Anatolia, but has finally been turned back by a staunch defense of Hungary."
209603 "Undaunted, the Turks turn their attention to the Mediterranean, where they intend to break the Christian naval powers of Venice and Spain."
209604 "Now, 200 rowed galleys and six heavy galleasses lumber into the Bay of Lepanto to meet the 270 galleys of the Turkish fleet.  The ships draw up with scarcely five miles separating the distance between them.  A storm of arrows darkens the sky, and the drone of splashing oars is finally drowned out by the thunder of cannon."
209651 "The heavy Venetian galleasses broke through the Turkish lines and trampled over the smaller ships of the Turks, but there were too few of the galleasses to win the battle on their own.  The Spanish and Venetians attempted to grapple and board the Turkish ships, where the superior experience and weapons of the Christian sailors could be brought to bear."
209652 "As the day wore on, the Turkish juggernaut began to run out of strength.  Scores of Turkish galleys were dashed on the rocks and others sank to the bottom of the bay.  Less than fifty Turkish ships survived the battle."
209653 "Lepanto was not the climax of the conflict between the Christians and the Turks on the Mediterranean, but it was a turning point.  The Turks had difficulty rebuilding their fleet back to its former size, while the Christians continued to update their fleets with the latest technological advancements, ensuring a decisive military advantage for further encounters on the high seas."

// 09-7 - Kyoto

209701 "The ships slide through a mirror-flat ocean stained red with spring seaweed.  Columns of rock improbably draped with pine trees tower out of the mist.  The men on the ships watch silently as the samurai prowl the deck above.  They will make land near Kyoto and their lord, Hideyoshi, will lead the siege of the city of ten-thousand shrines."
209702 "Within Kyoto, rebels hold prisoner Lord Nobunaga--the man who would unify Japan. The islands of Japan remain a patchwork of bickering samurai warlords who still settle conflicts with ritualized duels.  Nobunaga seeks to forge a single Japan, dragging the provincial samurai into the modern era."
209703 "Like his master Nobunaga, Hideyoshi wins his battles by volleys of muskets, fully exploiting the firearms recently introduced by Portuguese sailors. Hideyoshi intends no bargaining--he will demand once for Nobunaga's release, and then storm the city."
209751 "Kyoto paid dearly for Nobunaga's death, and in the end, Hideyoshi was able to accomplish what his mentor could not--by 1590, Japan was a unified country.  Great though it was, this accomplishment did not satisfy Hideyoshi, who then set about on an ambitious plan to conquer China and Korea."
209752 "Japan was not free of conflict, as civil wars continued to rise and fall for many years.  However, the Ieyasu family, former allies of Hideyoshi, continued to rule Japan as Shoguns until the 19th century."

// 09-8 - Noryang Point

209801 "The haze of spent gunpowder hangs over the gravel-strewn beach, confusing the seabirds that nest on the rocky outcroppings of Chinhae Bay.  As soon as the winds of the Eastern Sea disrupt the cloud, the Japanese navy will return, cannons blazing at the seawalls and what remains of the Korean fleet.  Although the army has so far managed to repel any of the samurai that have waded ashore, it is only a matter of time before the Japanese are victorious."
209802 "The last hope for the Korean navy is an innovative commander named Yi Sun-shin.  Admiral Yi is constructing a secret weapon--a ship with iron armor that can withstand the Japanese cannon and a spiked hull to repel boarders.  He calls these ships Kobukson, or Turtle Ships.  If Admiral Yi can ready his fleet of Turtle Ships in time, then the Koreans stand a chance of defeating the Japanese.  On the other hand, if he is too late..."
209851 "The Japanese were unable to establish a base in either China or Korea.  Therefore, all supplies and reinforcements had to come from the Japanese islands themselves.  Once Admiral Yi destroyed the Japanese navy, the samurai armies were left isolated, and the invasion ended."
209852 "Yi Sun-shin died in the battle, but the Japanese commander, Hideyoshi, died soon after, and with him, the lust for Japanese conquest.  The possibility of a Japanese empire in eastern Asia in the 16th century died under the guns of slow, but deadly, armored Korean warships."


// 10 - Alaric

210101 "Each night I have the same two visions. One of a field of wheat stalks swaying in the wind..."
210102 "... another of bright burning flames, trampling horse hooves, and loud screams."
210103 "My people, the Visigoths, came to Roman lands not as an invading army, but as a people running from a scourge... No! A plague sent by God himself!"
210104 "We warned the Romans of the impending danger, but they ignored us. They despised and distrusted our kind. They treated us poorly, gave us barren lands, and when we suffered famine they made us sell our children for food. Inevitably, we went to war, and our great army struck a decisive blow to the Romans at Hadrianople. We slew their emperor and forced them to allow our people to settle in Roman lands."
210105 "Our victory taught the Romans to not underestimate Gothic warriors. In exchange for the land they gave us, our young men would serve in the Roman armies, fighting alongside our former enemies. As wars broke out between the eastern and western halves of the empire, we gathered our spears and served Rome in battle."
210151 "The dead bodies of young Goth warriors littered the flanks of the Julian Alps."
210152 "For all the blood we shed, the Romans did not give us even a crumb of gratitude. A Gothic commander in the Roman army encouraged us to desert and go back to our people. 'Hardship is upon your families, wives, and children, and your people need your help now more than ever,' he said."
210153 "Few had heard of Alaric, this Gothic commander, but he managed to gain a strong reputation during his service in the Roman army. He was a tall man with a voice that could silence a crowd. When Alaric spoke, all heads turned in his direction and his eyes flickered with an inextinguishable fire."

210201 "The elders of the Visigothic tribes elected Alaric king of the Visigoths. Never before had there been a single king, but never before had there been a man like Alaric."
210202 "We were drawn into another war with Rome. The Romans had failed to fulfill their promises of lands for our families and Alaric was determined to force them to remember their promises. He marched our army south into Greece; 'The days the Romans ignored the Visigoths are over!' he declared. 'We will set fire to Hellas!'"
210251 "Ancient cities - once renowned for their philosophers and soldiers - were sacked and burned to ash. The world was changing rapidly, but Alaric had seen visions."
210252 "Despite our victories, the eastern Romans still refused to meet our envoys. Instead, we turned west. The half-Vandal general, Stilicho, was the driving power behind the Western Roman Empire. He knew Alaric from when our king served the Romans. We hoped Stilicho would be more willing to negotiate."

210301 "Rumors spread that Stilicho was ready to make a deal with Alaric. Our hopes were raised, but as weeks passed with no news, we knew that more Gothic blood would have to be shed."
210302 "The Romans resented Stilicho for making a pact with 'barbarians.' When parts of the Western Roman Empire were overrun by usurpers and foreign invaders, they blamed Stilicho. He soon learned the hefty price of Roman politics: they declared him an enemy of the state and had him executed."
210303 "In a frenzy of hate, the Romans followed Stilicho's execution by murdering all soldiers of Germanic descent. Then, in another rush of blind rage, they turned on the families of those soldiers, and murdered them too."
210304 "The survivors flocked to Alaric, begging him to raise his army and march with them into Italy to exact vengeance."
210305 "Alaric coldly answered them, 'The Romans have never known fear, but that will change.'"
210351 "For all that the Romans did to us, it seemed logical for Alaric to seek their downfall, but that is not what he wanted. After sacking the cities of Northern Italy, he met with the Roman emperor, Honorius. Alaric's demands were reasonable and humble, a sign of reconciliation between our two peoples. And all would have gone well, had it not been for the Gothic commander Sarus."
210352 "Sarus had vied with Alaric over the Visigothic kingship and had lost dishonorably, instead entering Roman service. Jealous of Alaric, he ordered his soldiers to attack our king by surprise and kill him."
210353 "Luckily, Alaric and his men survived the assassination attempt, and escaped."

210401 "Never had I seen Alaric lose his temper, but Sarus' betrayal infuriated him. He ordered me, his brother-in-law, to commence the siege of Rome."
210402 "The walls of Rome were huge and had not been breached since Brennus and his Gauls. However years of decline had weakened the city and its walls were badly in need of repairs."
210403 "Inciting the men to battle, Alaric vowed, 'If the Romans want fire and steel, it is fire and steel that we will give them!'"
210451 "During the long weeks spent besieging Rome, Alaric's calm nature returned. He issued an order to the warriors to spare the city when conquered. In his heart, he could not find the will to destroy the empire he had served, though it had betrayed him one too many times."
210452 "Our brave soldiers breached the walls and the defenses quickly crumbled before the weight of Visigothic men rushing into the breaches."
210453 "Our men looted the city for days. We stripped statues and monuments of their gold, and loaded carts with so many precious goods that the wheels were close to breaking. At the end of the third day, a caravan of ox-drawn wagons carrying plunder could be seen as far as the eye could see."
210454 "The Romans would write of that day: 'In one city, the whole world perished.'"

210501 "With Roman treachery repaid, Alaric looked to the future of our people. He planned to sail us to the fertile Roman province of Africa, but before we left, he passed from this world. Our people mourned for days and Alaric's body was buried underneath a river stream - the channel diverted to dig the grave, then made to flow again, hiding his tomb forever."
210502 "Soon after, the fleet that was to take us to Africa sank in a storm. Once again, desperation fell upon our people."
210503 "It was at that moment of despair that I, as the dead king's brother-in-law, spoke. I reminded everyone of Alaric's dream, of his commitment to the survival of our people, and of the impossible obstacles we had overcome. I told them that Alaric and I shared the same vision, a vision that we, in honor of his memory, ought to fulfill."
210504 "I concluded, 'Alaric has carved a path for us, and that path leads to Gaul!'"
210551 "Each night I have the same two visions."
210552 "One of a field of wheat stalks swaying in the wind. Another of bright burning flames, trampling horse hooves, and loud screams."
210553 "My people, the Visigoths, live peacefully in the rich lands of southern Gaul. Our farms flourish and our cattle grow in number every day. But for all our fortune, I cannot shake the ominous visions I have every night."
210554 "Like Alaric, I have seen the future."
210555 "The Huns are coming and they will stop at nothing..."


// 11 - Dracula

211101 "We could not make camp in the damp forest glade, so I led my companions along an old path towards the base of the mountain. It was overgrown with all manner of foliage, and the footing was difficult. Armor and weapons littered the path, and stakes stood tall, covered with vines and moss."
211102 "Glancing around, I spotted a magnificent blade. Light yet firm and unblemished by the elements, it shone in the rain and lightning, a lone light in the darkening trail. The hilt was fashioned from steel, inlaid with silver and gold to form the figure of a defiant, wingless dragon."
211103 "As we reached the summit, I could not believe my eyes. A ruined yet imposing castle loomed above us. Quietly rejoicing, my comrades moved towards their new camp. Then we heard the howls. Two massive wolves bounded out of the door of the castle towards my soldiers."
211104 "Fearing for their lives, they drew weapons, only to hear a voice from the shadows address the wolves--or the men--in a thick Wallachian accent. \"Stand down, fellows!\" Throwing large slabs of meat to the ravenous wolves, he calmed them and satiated their hunger."
211105 "Then he turned to us. \"Welcome to Poenari Castle, the ancient stronghold of the Draculesti.\" The mysterious man raised his hands in a gesture of welcome. \"It is well that your path has led you here. Come inside, sit by the fire, and feast while I tell you the tale of Vlad Dracula.\""
211151 "I stepped forth, holding out the mysterious sword and scabbard for our host to inspect. \"The Order of the Dragon,\" he said at once. \"What you have just brought me is the lost blade of Vlad Dracula himself!\""
211152 "I was shocked and immediately demanded an explanation. Our host's eyes flashed and there was a strained look on his face. Finally, the rush of memories seemed to slow and become more controlled. \"That is a long story...but then again, we have a long time until dawn.\""
211153 "\"Dracula sought refuge at the Moldavian court. There, he learned that Vladislav II had begun to mediate peace talks between the Ottomans and Hungarians, securing his position as Voivod of Wallachia. Furious, Dracula swore vengeance on Ottomans, Wallachian boyars, and Danesti clansmen alike.\""

211201 "\"Dracula knew that he needed to enlist the aid of the Hungarians against Vladislav II, whose policies favored the Ottomans. He also remembered his education under the crusading Order of the Dragon, and wanted to honor his vows.\""
211202 "\"The Order was a powerful ally, and their crusader knights would serve Dracula well against his enemies. As he paced the streets of the Moldavian capital, Dracula mused over his plan to reclaim his kingdom...\" As the mysterious old man paused, I rose up to take another slab of venison."
211203 "The old man stared into the fire, watching the flames dance as if they were soldiers involved in a raging battle. His eyes flashed again as a thought entered his mind, and he grasped the majestic old sword."
211204 "Meanwhile, Sultan Mehmed II had ascended to the Ottoman throne. Dracula loathed Mehmed from their time in Edirne, and he knew that the Turks would be a thorn in his side for years to come. In 1453, they had conquered Constantinople, but they were presently occupied with campaigns in Greece and Serbia."
211205 "Bogdan II, Dracula's cousin and the new Voivod of Moldavia, had heard of his kinsman's plight and offered his help. If Dracula could cross the Carpathian Mountains into Transylvania and ally with Hungary, then they could launch a three-pronged assault on Vladislav II and the Turks."
211251 "The elderly man gave a thin smile. \"Tenacity of mind can compensate for other disadvantages. As Dracula slaughtered untold numbers of enemy troops, the large circle of impaled men outside Targoviste grew to awe--and disgust--travelers for weeks to come.\""
211252 "\"Dracula owned Wallachia once more, but it was not the land his forebears ruled. Barren from endless wars, it was rife with corruption, crime, and poverty.\" Aghast, I asked my host how Dracula managed to reform a ruined shell of a country so quickly."
211253 "Grinning, the light flashed across the old man's eye again. \"Dracula despised dishonesty and crime, and sought to eliminate it. He knew that Wallachia had to become strong enough to face its enemies-and soon. And so his reforms began.\""

211301 "\"The punishment for all offenses was death, for Dracula needed to make an example of criminals. Under his strong rule, trade was reopened and the economy blossomed. Proud of his achievement, Dracula placed a golden cup in the central square of Targoviste. The cup was never once touched throughout his reign.\""
211302 "I was shocked. The fear of the stake was surely enough to prevent crime, but to rule Wallachia while simultaneously evading the plots of the boyars was no small feat."
211303 "\"Dracula invited all of the boyars to a feast, and asked them how many rulers they had seen perish due to treachery. None had seen fewer than seven reigns, while some had even seen thirty! Furious, Dracula arrested them all and marched them here, to the former ruin of Poenari Castle!\""
211304 "\"For months they labored to rebuild the castle, toiling even after their clothes fell off! Those who survived were slain. Finally, Dracula had eradicated the fickle, conniving Boyars. He replaced them with loyal followers, be they knights or common peasants.\""
211305 "\"Strong again, the Dragon was ready to breathe a flame that would engulf his enemies, the Turks.\""
211351 "This wise man, whomever he was, was certainly no commoner. I wondered aloud if perhaps he had fought in the wars of which he spoke."
211352 "My question was answered with a grin and a nod. I was awed - to encounter a soldier who had survived those years of turmoil and bloody warfare was rare."
211353 "\"We sacked Giurgiu, Darstor, Novoselo, Dridopoyrom, and many more towns,\" he muttered, revealing the scars on his arms. \"Our strikes were swifter than bolts of lightning. Yes, we have peace now, but I have never found it. Not a single day goes by when I do not think about it.\""

211401 "\"Dracula never breathed a word of it, but many began to think that his time at the Ottoman court had stoked his hatred for his southern neighbor. For years, he had brooded over his brother Radu, who had treacherously pledged himself to the Turks.\""
211402 "\"Dracula also had his vows to the Order of the Dragon to consider. The Pope and the Hungarian regent both desired war with the Turks.\""
211403 "\"In the year 1462, Sultan Mehmed II renewed his efforts and sent a force of 18,000 into Wallachia. Thinking that Dracula would be unable to mobilize his army quickly enough, the Sultan sought to take Wallachia by storm with this small force. He was, of course, sadly mistaken.\""
211404 "I had heard whispers of the Danube butchering, but never a firsthand account. Dracula's enduring ability to overcome the most fearsome force of his time mesmerized me."
211405 "\"Dracula had a thirst for blood unlike any other, but he was fair. His sense of justice wrought a change in all of us. Dracula taught us to use our strengths to our advantage! Terror, speed, and surprise became weapons more potent than our blades...\""
211451 "\"Unfortunately, this was where my lord and I were separated. The Turks entered the castle courtyard at Poenari with murder on their minds and ransacked the fortress that we had fought so hard to defend. Taking refuge in a secret tunnel, I watched Dracula's boat float downstream.\""
211452 "\"The stone bastions of Poenari never caught flame, so I was spared. As if God was with us, an avalanche struck the departing Turkish army and blocked the route to the castle.” Although this 'evidence' of divine retribution stirred our host, I figured that it was caused by the enemy cannon."
211453 "I was not eased by the change in the mood of our host. The calls of wolves and bats filled the air as we feasted. It seemed that the old man was lost in ruminations of times long gone by."

211501 "Finally the ancient warrior resumed his tale. \"It was a long twelve years. I was alone, waiting here for signs of Dracula's return, but all I ever saw were Turkish marauders ravaging the countryside of this once beautiful land and tormenting the people.\""
211502 "\"One thing kept me from despair: the last words I had heard from my lord--that he would return in the end. I repeated these words to myself every day, and promised myself that he would succeed. It was a fool's hope, but it was the best that I had.\""
211503 "\"So I endured. Dracula had preserved enough food and water in the castle to last an entire army several years.\""
211504 "\"I had begun to think that he never would return, but rumor among the locals told me differently. When I overheard the same as I spied on Turkish patrols, I became more confident. I shuddered at the sight of the land that he would return to.\""
211505 "\"One day, I awoke to the thundering of hooves and the frenzied war cries of soldiers pouring down from the Carpathians. It was Dracula, at the head of a Hungarian army, come at last to liberate us from the yoke of the Turks and their Wallachian puppet, Basarab Laiota...\""
211551 "\"Dracula achieved victory at last and the invaders fled before him. Rallying his men, he charged the enemy ranks with an unspeakable vengeance that emboldened his army. A decisive victory was near, but it was at that hour that Dracula's luck ran out.\""
211552 "\"A volley of arrows whistled through the air and struck Dracula in the chest, knocking him from his horse. The Turks easily routed our leaderless forces and our chance to drive them out vanished. The occupation resumed and the survivors despaired.\""
211553 "The memory of a great man endures forever. As a token of gratitude, I invited our host to join us in a pilgrimage to the monastery at Snagov to pay our respects to Dracula's grave. Tears running down his face, the elderly man could do naught but nod in reply."


// 12 - Bari

212101 "I left the walls drenched in the sweat and blood of the tenacious Norman besiegers. My comrades and I usually would rush straight to the inn after a fight-but not today. My father, the heroic Michael Nautikos, savior of Bari, awaited me."
212102 "I found the wizened old man staring out the window towards the enemy camp. \"Foul, treacherous mercenary scum! Son, the inhabitants of this peninsula have courted mercenaries for centuries. Not one bit of good it did them!\""
212103 "Weary of discussing Normans, whose nature I knew all too well, I inquired about our rich family heritage. I asked my father instead to tell me of our ancestor Panos."
212104 "My father spun around, his eyes gleaming. \"You wish to hear the story of the family? Our Greek blood runs back generations! Nautikos, our surname-it is so because we came as sailors.\""
212105 "\"In the year 869, the knight Panos Nautikos answered the summons of his Byzantine liege, Emperor Basil II. He was to lead a force by sea to aid our ally Louis II, the Frankish king, against the Emirate of Bari.\""
212151 "\"Panos was offered lordship of Bari after his victory, but he declined, wishing to live out his days in peace. Having brought glory to his house, he settled down and started a family.\""
212152 "The old man mused for a while, his memory slowed by wine. \"Louis, on the other hand, ran into trouble with the Lombards. They were not fond of yet another Frankish conqueror treading on their soil.\""
212153 "Suddenly, a bell rang, signaling an attack and calling the city to arms. I donned my armor and rushed out the door, leaving my father to his thoughts."

212201 "I walked downstairs the next morning in a daze. The battle of the previous night was fresh in my mind, and it chilled my blood. I whirled around, and found myself staring straight into my father's eyes."
212202 "\"Nothing shakes the ghosts of battle like a fine story, son. Come, sit down to a meal, and I shall tell you of the rebellion of Melus!\""
212203 "The sun shone onto my father's gaunt face. He had a head of thick grey hair and his limbs remained strong from years as a sailor and a soldier."
212204 "\"I have donned mail since the year 1005, when I was but a lad in the service of Melus, the highest-ranking nobleman in the city. Ambitious and eager to prove myself, I soon became his best man.\""
212205 "\"Melus was passionate, but his withdrawn, stealthy manner began to stir my distrust. When he invited all manner of mercenary troops into our beautiful city, I began to fear the worst.\""
212251 "My father stood up to tend the fire. \"1011. It had been 2 years since I had stood in the courtyard of Melus' castle in Bari.\""
212252 "\"With the rebel garrison defeated, Bari was once again in Byzantine hands. Unsurprisingly, the local catepan, or lord, asked me to remain at the head of the force that I had recruited.\""
212253 "\"Most of Melus' family was captured and imprisoned, but Melus and his brother, Dattus, were still at large in the countryside. The rebellion was far from over.\""

212301 "My father coughed and took another draught of wine. \"Melus sought aid from Salerno, while Dattus fortified a tower on the Garigliano River. From there, they gathered support  and renewed their strength.\""
212302 "\"Melus reached far for help. Lombards, Germans, and Apulians answered the call, eager for glory and plunder. But there was one more group whose help Melus enlisted!\""
212303 "\"A new generation of Norman adventurers, forebears of the scum who attack our city as we speak. It is because of Melus that this new menace is upon us.\""
212304 "\"In response, the Byzantine Emperor sent the general Basil Boioannes and an elite force of the fabled Varangian Guard to meet Melus in the field and crush the rebellion for good.\""
212305 "\"The armies drew up near the River Ofanto, not far from where the Romans had clashed with Hannibal of Carthage some twelve centuries earlier. The fate of the Mezzogiorno was about to be decided...\""
212351 "\"Not unlike its predecessor, the Second Battle of Cannae was a massacre. The Lombards and their Norman allies were no match for Boioannes' strategic prowess and the ferocity of his Varangian troops.\""
212352 "\"Melus fled the field and sought refuge with the Pope, which sent him to the court of the Holy Roman Emperor. He gradually poisoned the minds of several influential courtiers and, eventually, the Emperor himself.\""
212353 "\"Melus died in exile, but the effects of his political machinations were soon to be felt throughout Italy.\""

212401 "\"The rebellion was over, but Boioannes still had a difficult task before him. The once-rich province of Apulia lay in tatters, and the hostility of its northern neighbors did not bode well for the future.\""
212402 "\"Melus' brother Dattus still preyed on the surrounding lands from his lair on the Garigliano. Additionally, rumor quickly spread of Holy Roman armies massing in the north.\""
212403 "\"Boioannes was not about to let his hard-earned gains slip away like a fish from the net. The odds were against him, but he had a loyal army and a plan.\""
212404 "\"The Apennine pass was the gateway to southern Italy, and Boioannes intended to fortify it. Thousands of soldiers and masons followed him to the ruins of Aecae, an ancient Roman city near the mountains, and began construction of a citadel named Troia.\""
212405 "\"Boioannes would restore the grandeur of Byzantine power in Italy, or die in the effort.\""
212451 "\"The Holy Roman Empire was no trifling opponent. Many good men fell parrying the assaults on Troia.\""
212452 "\"Boioannes' forces struck out at Dattus' tower on the Garigliano and dragged him from it. Following the ancient Roman custom, Dattus was confined in a leather sack with a rooster, a monkey, and a viper, and cast into the sea.\""
212453 "\"Byzantine Italy flourished under Boioannes' tenure as catepan. Alas that the incompetence of his successors have brought us to this dreadful pass...\""

212501 "Young men seek renown on the battlefield, thinking war a noble affair. Little do they know that their quarries are in vain. There is nothing but chaos, the screams of dying men, and the stench of death."
212502 "I long for peace and cheer. I can hardly remember the sound of music in the streets and the noises of a bustling city on market day."
212503 "They have been replaced by the din of battle, the whistling of rocks hurled by Norman catapults, and the solemn evening tales in the taverns told by those who cannot forget the carnage of each day."
212504 "My father approached, holding a sword and his old helm, breastplate, faulds, and greaves. \"They are yours now. For 200 years, our family has proudly served this city, but today you must leave this place.\""
212505 "\"I am too old for the journey, but if you live, my death will not be in vain. Someday, you will tell your son this story with the same pride as I have. Fight well today, escape, and secure yourself that future.\""
212551 "The morning sun shone on the shores of the Aegean. I was speaking to a miller when I heard shouts from the harbor. Racing to the docks, I recognized several Barians disembarking from a battered vessel."
212552 "The tidings were grim: Bari was in Norman hands and my father had fallen valiantly along with it. I thought of his parting words, but I doubt that I will ever don his armaments again. Like my ancestor Panos, I have seen enough battle for ten lifetimes."
212553 "I think I shall travel the Empire from Thessaly to Anatolia, seeking work as I go. With all luck, I will earn enough wealth to buy a house in the countryside, and raise miles of vineyards on the hillside."
212554 "Perhaps, one day, when I recount the tale of my family to my children and grandchildren, I will be able to conclude it with how we have found peace at last."


// 13 - Sforza

213101 "So, you want to know about Sforza? I will tell you about Francesco Sforza."
213102 "Sforza was like me. We were condottieri - 'contract men.' When the Italian princes were too rich or too cowardly to get their hands dirty, they paid us."
213103 "We fought because they paid us to fight. We stole because they paid us to steal. And when they did not pay, we made sure someone did. We sold ourselves to the highest bidder, and if another prince came with a bigger purse, we did not hesitate to change sides. Honor was cheaper than silver, but for Sforza..."
213104 "Sforza was different. He was in it for his own glory."
213105 "That is why he took the Visconti contract. He wanted to make a name for himself - to be more than the bastard son of a dead mercenary. He needed a patron: an ambitious prince with many enemies and more gold than friends. Filippo Visconti, the Duke of Milan, was the obvious choice."
213106 "Visconti had all the ambitions of Caesar, but none of the courage. He was craven and paranoid, but at least he paid - well, most of the time. And whether his ambitions meant war with Florence or with Venice, Visconti always needed contract men. That is why he hired condottieri like Sforza and Niccolo Piccinino - hungry men looking to make a name for themselves."
213151 "Visconti distrusted and hated us, but I do not blame him; his own brother was murdered by a condottiero on the steps of a church. Visconti saw Sforza's successes as a threat and plotted to have him killed."
213152 "But instead of running to safety, Sforza confronted the duke directly. To our surprise, Visconti was so impressed by this boldness that he dismissed the charges against Sforza and betrothed the soldier to his daughter Bianca. This made Sforza the duke's heir."
213153 "I will say this about Sforza: he was a scoundrel, but he was no coward. And his courage was always repaid."

213201 "After the wars with Venice, Visconti made sure he got his gold's worth out of us. He sent Sforza south to enforce the duke's claims in Romagna. I think the duke was having second thoughts about Sforza - after we left, Piccinino and his men followed us."
213202 "Sforza could see through the plot. Although he was betrothed to the duke's daughter, he knew Visconti was fickle. He also knew that being a landless condottiero was a risky proposition. Sforza needed to be his own man and have his own land - a refuge if the machinations of his employers turned against him; or if they demanded justice for Sforza's own treachery."
213203 "What better opportunity than to use Visconti's weapons and money to his own benefit by making himself ruler of a city?"
213251 "Sforza and Piccinino were like two alley dogs fighting over a scrap of meat. They were natural rivals, precisely because they were so alike."
213252 "Of the two, Sforza had a certain pedigree; if you could call being the bastard of a mercenary captain 'pedigree.' From his father, Sforza inherited his furbizia -  cunning - and used it to get the best of his rivals, his patrons, and his women alike."
213253 "Piccinino, the son of a butcher, came into the profession as a soldier. He rose through the ranks and became an advisor to a trusting yet incompetent condottiero. In this position, Piccinino lured his captain into an ambush and took command of the company."
213254 "That Sforza and Piccinino would, years later, become blood enemies was as inevitable as two dogs fighting over a single piece of meat."

213301 "If Sforza thought taking territory would make him safe, he was a fool. The King of Naples looked hungrily northward to the cities so easily taken by a rogue mercenary."
213302 "Sforza needed allies. Sigismondo Malatesta came with a Venetian force, as did Sforza's ever-loyal cousin Micheletto. But the condottiero needed a more powerful ally. He took his biggest gamble by going to meet an old friend."
213303 "You might have thought that when Sforza walked into the Milanese court that Visconti would have ordered him arrested - or that Piccinino would have personally killed him. But surprisingly, Visconti accepted Sforza like a father accepts his wayward son. Sforza and the duke's daughter were finally wed and the implication was obvious - Sforza would rule Milan when Visconti died."
213304 "Whatever the duke's intentions, this favoring of the prodigal son incensed Piccinino. He furiously tore his contract and stormed out of Milan."
213305 "If Visconti would not see Sforza for what he was, Piccinino would find another patron. Pledging himself to the King of Naples, Piccinino had one goal: to destroy Sforza."
213351 "The battle between Sforza and Piccinino was the centerpiece of the war over Italy. Sforza served Milan against Piccinino's Neapolitans, and then Piccinino returned to Milan's service while Sforza went to the Venetians. No matter which banners they fought under, the rivalry between the two men became the one constant of the war."
213352 "But Sforza's furbizia proved to be decisive. He defeated Piccinino in battles across northern and central Italy. The disgraced Piccinino was finally relieved by Visconti and spent his last breaths in Milan cursing Sforza's name to his two sons. With his rival and equal finally defeated, Sforza seemed destined to fulfill his grandest ambitions."
213353 "Then, by a twist of fate, Filippo Visconti died, undoing all of Sforza's plans."

213401 "Visconti's death left Milan in turmoil. Outlying towns rebelled and Venice threatened the city."
213402 "By way of marriage, Sforza held a better claim on Milan than anyone, but strangely, the ambitious captain did not take his dowry. He allowed the lawyers and professors of Milan to fashion a republic with all the trappings and corruption of the old Roman one. They called it the Golden Ambrosian Republic after Saint Ambrose, but there was nothing blessed or saintly about this republic."
213403 "Surrounded by enemies, the Republicans of Milan - more skilled at reading books than leading men in war - needed a captain to command the war against Venice. Sforza, by now employed by the Venetians along with his compatriots Malatesta and Micheletto, did not miss an opportunity to once again betray those who paid him - as well as those closest to him."
213404 "Rescinding his own claims on Milan, he agreed to serve the Republic against his own cousin Micheletto in exchange for control of the city of Brescia. The leaders of the Republic agreed, even though there were many rumblings that Sforza could not be trusted. After all, for a piece of land he was now marching against his own blood."
213451 "Though Milan grew stronger with Sforza's victories, the Republicans came to fear and hate him. They saw Sforza as a Caesar intending to topple their new republic. These bookish professors and lawyers listened intently to two agitators who had returned to Milan - two brothers with harsh words and a fierce vendetta against Sforza."
213452 "The sons of none other than Piccinino swore vengeance upon Sforza. They incited the Republicans to betray him by signing a secret truce with Brescia before Sforza could take that city. This, of course, angered the condottiero. He had agreed to serve the Republic only in exchange for the city."
213453 "Stifling the ambitions of a man like Sforza was a fatal mistake..."

213501 "Milan was prepared for the siege. Bronze cannons lined the walls and a vast militia was trained. Even the hoarding merchants sold their possessions to arm the mercenaries of the Piccinino brothers. Milan sent emissaries to convince the Duke of Savoy that Sforza would threaten all of Italy. Thousands of Savoyard troops marched against Sforza."
213502 "But battles are not only won on the field with men and horses - they can also be won in a dark tent over a barrel of wine. In one such tent, Sforza met with Malatesta, now commander of the Venetian troops."
213503 "Malatesta listened as Sforza ranted furiously of Milan's treachery. He knew that Sforza was not angry that the Republic had betrayed him, as much as that it had done so before Sforza could betray the Republic."
213504 "But Sforza offered an opportunity for Malatesta and his Venetian employers. While Sforza hurled his men and his riches against Milan's walls, the Venetians would be free to conquer the rest of northern Italy. Malatesta agreed to help Sforza, but, as always, alliance and treachery between condottieri were only opposite sides of the same coin."
213551 "Hunger and disease spread in the besieged city. The soldiers left the walls and turned their weapons inward - to the cloistered professors and lawyers who had promised them liberty, but at a great cost."
213552 "Is it better to be feared or loved? In that moment, Sforza was both."
213553 "Milan opened her gates and Sforza lavished the people with all of the grain - their own grain - that he had taken during the siege. The grateful, if foolish, people crowned Sforza - that treacherous, conniving, selfish bastard - Duke of Milan. It was not his final triumph, but it was his grandest."
213554 "That is the story of Sforza from one who fought with him - and against him. Do I wish ill upon him? No more than I would wish ill on the fox who raids the henhouse in the black of night. It does only what a fox does and cannot be blamed for it. I do not blame Sforza any more than I would blame myself."
213555 "After all, Sforza's blood is in me, for I am his cousin, Micheletto. Sforza is like me - we are condottieri. We are the contract men of Italy."


// 14 - Pachacuti

214101 "'So, you want to know why this region is called the Field of Blood?' The old man peered over in astonishment from his seat in the shadow of his stone hut. He smiled mischievously as he continued, 'You are probably not from here. If you were, you would not have asked such a question.'"
214102 "I nodded in affirmation, for the old man was right: I was a merchant from the south. 'It is the first time that my path has led to Cuzco, the heart of the Inca Empire', I explained."
214103 "'You are fortunate that you have chosen to rest in my village, my young and illiterate friend,' the old man told me, rising and pointing to the entrance of his dwelling."
214104 "You must know that I am the most renowned storyteller in the entire valley. If there is anyone in the world who can explain why the plain that surrounds us has that ominous name, it is I,' he said, gesturing to me to enter his house."
214105 "'Today, all inhabitants of this region are full of admiration for our empire,' he boasted, 'but everything that is now subject to the Inca had to be conquered. Who knows? If not for Viracocha Inca, we all might still be simple farmers like I am.'"
214106 "'During the years before his reign, many nearby tribes were periodically conquered, but no garrisons or Inca officials were placed among them. This pattern of raiding and plundering changed during the reign of Viracocha. He would establish permanent rule over the neighboring tribes.'"
214151 "'Viracocha was convinced that he was favored by the gods,' the old man continued in a tone that suddenly seemed scornful, 'but in truth he owed his victories to his two generals: Vicaquirao and Apo Mayta. They were the strategists behind the military tactics that made the conquest of the Cuzco valley possible in the first place.'"
214152 "'Viracocha was too conceited to realize that, and his pride following their hard-fought triumph nearly led the Inca to ruin.'"

214201 "When the old man had begun his story, the hut had been flooded by sunlight. The golden disk had long since sunk below the horizon, and the light of the embers dancing around in the darkness only faintly illuminated his wrinkled face. He refilled his clay mug and then continued the story."
214202 "'Viracocha believed that his reign was sacred and that he was protected by divine providence. However, the gods had turned away from him towards a new favorite: a wild, young warlord named Anccu Hualloc. He hailed from the Chanca tribes and had recruited more than 40,000 warriors, with whom he marched on Cuzco!'"
214203 "'The inhabitants were sure that their beloved ruler would remain strong and drive out the invaders. Sadly, Viracocha had grown old and fear had infected his heart. Together with Urqu, his favorite son, he fled, abandoning his people to their fate.'"
214204 "'Not all of Viracocha's sons were as cowardly as their father. Cusi Yupanqui refused to follow his aged father, and instead took command of the defense. Full of confidence, he announced that he would defeat the Chanca army. However, the few soldiers remaining in the city could not be impressed by bold words, as Cusi Yupanqui had no military experience to justify his claim. Luckily, Vicaquirao and Apo Mayta had also remained in Cuzco...'"
214251 "I was captivated by the words of the old man. When he had finished, I exclaimed: 'So, that is why this area is called Yawarpampa, the Field of Blood!' His eyes sparkled."
214252 "'Yes, the ground on which my hut stands today was watered by the blood of the Chanca. Cusi Yupanqui, with the help of his generals, had accomplished the impossible: Cuzco had been saved from an overwhelmingly superior force.'"
214253 "'The name of Cusi Yupanqui soon fell into oblivion, but only because the people that he had saved from the Chanca invasion began to call their savior Pachacuti Inca Yupanqui, 'he who overturns space and time.' Now, there were also those who wished immediately to rid themselves of the victorious hero. His own family, driven by jealousy, began to conspire against him.'"

214301 "The moon had risen, but sleep was far from my mind. I hung on the words of the old man, who did not seem the least bit tired. It was as if the more he talked about Pachacuti, the livelier he became."
214302 "'I told you about the great battle of Cuzco,' he continued, 'but you must know that this glorious victory did not bring peace to the Inca. On the contrary, a civil war broke out, for the success of his son filled Pachacuti's father with envy.'"
214303 "Viracocha still wished for his son Urqu to become king of the Inca, although everyone could see that Pachacuti was far more capable. After all, it was he who defended Cuzco, the holy city, while Urqu had fled into the mountains along with Viracocha."
214304 "Although Viracocha had grown old and died a bitter man shortly thereafter, Urqu did not intend to yield. He entrenched himself in Calas, a mountain fortress, and proclaimed himself Sapa Inca, supreme ruler."
214305 "Of course, the thought of coming to terms with his treacherous brother did not once cross Pachacuti's mind. Gathering his warriors, he led them to Calas to eliminate Urqu once and for all."
214351 "The old man sneered as he described the end of Urqu, who was slain in battle. 'For the Inca, the end of Urqu was a blessing,' he told me, 'for it left Pachacuti the undisputed ruler, and it showed that he was not only a valiant warlord but also a prudent king.'"
214352 "'Having refurnished the Temple of the Sun, he turned to rebuilding the entire city of Cuzco. He also built fortresses, palaces, roads and temples throughout the country. In addition, he issued wise decrees beyond count and led his kingdom into a golden age.'"
214353 "'I still believe that the people were right to hail Pachacuti as 'Son of the Sun,' for he had once again led the Incas out of the darkness.'"

214401 "The stories of Pachacuti and his followers fascinated me, so it filled me with joy when my host laid down his mug and continued. Clearly, his story was far from over. 'Pachacuti knew that the Inca would never live in peace if their greatest rivals, the Chanca, remained powerful. In any case, he had a score to settle with Anccu Hualloc, who had nearly succeeded in conquering Cuzco.'"
214402 "Pachacuti sent his troops north to occupy Waman Karpa, 'the Falcon's Tent,' capital of the Chanca. Once again, he tasked Vicaquirao and Apo Mayta, who remained at his side during the civil war, with the command of the army. Fueled by panic, the Chanca began to organize their defense, for it was now their turn to be hunted. The winds had shifted.'"
214451 "'At that time, it was common for Chanca warriors to intimidate their enemies by using cups fashioned from the skulls of prisoners to drink the blood of the slain. Even so, when the victorious Inca troops entered Waman Karpa, the remaining defenders had no choice but to surrender.'"
214452 "'Everyone thought that Pachacuti would take bloody revenge on the Chanca,' the old man explained, 'but Pachacuti instead chose mercy and integrated the surviving warriors of the Chanca into his army. Astonishingly enough, they became loyal followers and acknowledged the Inca king as their new overlord.'"
214453 "'The domain of the Inca was now greater than ever. Pachacuti's superiority had become too overwhelming and his armies too effective, leaving no tribes who could contend with the Inca - except for the Kingdom of Chimor, which was located near the coast to the west.'"

214501 "'You are still quite young, my friend,' the old man observed, smiling amicably, 'but look at me. At some point your hair will turn gray just like mine, and your hands will become wrinkled as well. A king will also grow old one day, even if he is the 'Son of the Sun'.'"
214502 "Pachacuti knew that he needed a capable successor to sustain the state that he had built. There was only one man who could be considered: his own son, Topa Yupanqui.'"
214503 "Topa Yupanqui seemed to have inherited his father's military skills. He already bore the title 'Apukispay,' leader of the imperial troops. To test his mettle, Pachacuti gave his son the command of the campaign against the Chimor Empire.'"
214504 "The Chimú were not to be underestimated. On the coast, they had built a magnificent city called Chan-Chan, whose splendor rivaled that of Cuzco itself. Massive canal systems fed the city with fresh water, and magnificent pyramids adorned the city. Chimor was quite wealthy due to the droves of slaves harvesting gold from the abundant sources nearby. The discipline of its military was the stuff of legend.'"
214505 "The people of Cuzco anxiously awaited the outcome of the campaign against the remote coastal kingdom. Would Topa Yupanqui succeed in completing the work of his father and bring the expansion of the Inca to a dignified conclusion?'"
214551 "The old man was silent for some time, but then addressed me: 'You have surely heard of the Tawantinsuyu, the realm of the four parts? That is what we call our empire, since Topa Yupanqui succeeded in subjugating the Chimú.'"
214552 "The lands to the north, south, east and west had finally been conquered, and the Inca now dominated the entire region--mountain and valley.'"
214553 "Knowing that his son was of equal wisdom and virtue, Pachacuti could die without regret. Now you know the entire story - the story of the Inca.'"
214554 "I hesitated for a moment before asking the old man: 'You have told me much indeed, but what was the fate of the two generals, Vicaquirao and Apo Mayta? Surely their story does not end there!'"
214555 "The old man beamed at me and laughed before giving his answer. 'Well, Vicaquirao gave his life in battle and died the most honorable death imaginable."
214556 "Apo Mayta was not quite as favored by fortune, however. It is said that, having grown older than the hills themselves, he now lives a life of solitude in a stone hut. From time to time, you might find him telling inquisitive travelers tales of bygone times that are so fantastic that they seem almost difficult to believe.'"


// 15 - Prithviraj

215101 "Long ago, a great and wise sage climbed the holy peak of Mount Abu. He sought the favor of the gods to protect the people of the earth, but he was descended upon by Rakshasas, man-eating demons with flame-red eyes and fangs like steel."
215102 "But though the demons neared, the sage was as immovable as the mountain itself. Though he felt the heat of the demons' breath on his bare shoulder, the sage was resolute - making the offering of fire to the gods and asking for their protection."
215103 "From the flames of his offering spawned the Rajput clans, born of fire and smoke. Their heroes fought the Rakshasas, but though much blood was shed, the demon menace continued to darken Mount Abu."
215104 "The sage dug a new fire pit, deeper into the mountain earth, and again made the offering. From this pit came Chauhan, weapons in his four arms. He slew the Rakshasas and from his loins came the mightiest of the Rajput clans. From this clan came my king."
215105 "I am Chand Bardai, poet of the raja's court. I will tell you the story of a great king, but this story, much like life itself, must start from the beginning. My king, Prithviraj, was not always a great raja. Once, he was a young king of Ajmer challenged by his own cousin for rule of the Chauhan clan."
215151 "In those days, the Rajput clans raided and warred with one another. They were Kshatriya - warriors from birth. A young Rajput like Prithviraj was headstrong and brave - but to be a wise king would take more than courage."
215152 "From his minister Kaimbasa, Prithviraj learned wisdom and how to rule. But the spirit of the Kshatriya would never leave him; my raja longed for new victories and lands to conquer."

215201 "Rajasthan is a harsh land: a desolate desert snaked by the winding fingers of the Ganga River. The Rajput clans who rule here are as tough as the desert soil and as passionate and unpredictable as the river's flows. The name Rajasthan means 'the land of the kings,' and from this land come India's greatest warriors and rajas."
215202 "A king named Jayachandra ruled the strongest of the clans. His experience and might was surpassed only by his bitter anger and ambition. He sought to rule all of Rajasthan."
215203 "In keeping with the ancient traditions, Jayachandra ordered a ritual signifying his authority. A mare was released into Rajasthan and pursued by the king's warriors. Wherever the horse went, the ruler of that land would either accept Jayachandra's authority or challenge it by fighting the warriors."
215204 "As Prithviraj hunted tigers in the forest, he discovered how quickly the hunter could himself become the hunted."
215251 "All of India heard tales of Prithviraj's digvijaya - his conquest of all directions. The Rajput princes submitted to him and word of his victories spread far. Princes came from all lands to congratulate the young raja."
215252 "But far greater than any princely gift was the love of a princess. In Kannauj, in the very court of his rival Jayachandra, Prithviraj caught the eye of Sanyogita, a headstrong Rajput princess with bewitching beauty. The young king fell in love with Jayachandra's own daughter."

215301 "My king was in love with Sanyogita. The two would sneak away from their courts to meet in border towns and wooded groves, where they would embrace under the bright light of the moon."
215302 "But for all their secrecy, their romance could not be hidden from the powerful Jayachandra and his army of spies."
215303 "The mighty king would never approve of his daughter marrying his own rival. Instead, he ordered a swayamvara - a ceremony where Sanyogita would choose her husband from the men invited by her father. Jayachandra invited all the princes and kings of India to the ceremony, except for one."
215304 "Almost one. In mockery of Prithviraj, Jayachandra had a clay statue made in the young king's image to serve as the doorman to his court."
215351 "Sanyogita was as headstrong as she was beautiful. With the infinite courage of a Rajput princess, she walked through the royal court carrying the ceremonial garland and ignoring the expectant gazes of her suitors. Coming to the door, she defiantly laid the garland around the neck of the clay statue of Prithviraj, declaring him her husband."
215352 "To her surprise, the young raja had braved the dangers of his rival's kingdom to slip into the ceremony. Emerging from behind the statue, Prithviraj embraced Sanyogita. The two rode to Ajmer as the furious Jayachandra vowed that his revenge would be felt to the ends of the earth."

215401 "Without his daughter, Jayachandra became a stampeding elephant - no one was safe from his overflowing rage. But anger alone could not win a war and Jayachandra would not have been a threat to my raja had it not been for the jealousy and cunning of a once loyal subject."
215402 "Oh Kaimbasa! How love and jealously made him betray his master! The minister who had advised my king since he was a boy, and whom Prithviraj honored like a beloved uncle, sought the one woman he could not have - Kaimbasa fell in love with Sanyogita. His jealousy drove him to Jayachandra's court to betray his own king."
215403 "Whispering in Jayachandra's ear, Kaimbasa gave direction and purpose to the king's anger."
215404 "He urged Jayachandra to send an ambassador to the Afghan hills to find Muhammad Ghori, a brutal warlord said to command a slave army numbering in the thousands. The messenger would regale the Turk with tales of the riches of Prithviraj's kingdom and whisper to him how the young king was too smitten with his bride to defend his lands."
215405 "Then, Kaimbasa promised the vengeful king, Prithviraj would be defeated and Jayachandra would rule Rajasthan."
215406 "Unknown to the two men, their fateful scheme would jeopardize all of India."
215451 "Thousands of Turkish horsemen - the slave soldiers of a savage warlord - descended from the Afghan hills to the plain at Tarain. Great clouds of dust rose in their wake, obstructing the vision of the Rajput Kshatriya. The Turkish cavalry unleashed a shower of arrows on the Rajputs. The Indian warriors, facing an enemy they could not see, could only weather the blows against them."
215452 "With the battle hanging in the balance, Govind Tai, brother of my king, rode alone into the dusty fray, challenging the Turkish warlord to single combat. He struck Muhammad Ghori from his horse and wounded him. The warlord's slaves encircled their master and carried him off the field as the Turkish trumpets bleated a retreat."

215501 "Prithviraj's victory over Muhammad Ghori proved to be a curse. Believing that the Turk would not return, my raja took to revelry and the company of Sanyogita, leaving the defenses to rot."
215502 "It is here that I, Chand Bardai, enter the story and make my mark on my king's legend. I warned my raja that nothing would stop the Turk. The warlord had come down from the barren Afghan mountains to gaze upon the wealth of India and would return with a larger army."
215503 "My raja was wise and he listened to me. He sent messengers to the other Rajput princes, calling them to war. But few listened."
215504 "Laughing, the princes told the messengers that surely the Turks would not return so soon after being bloodied by Rajput Kshatriya. The princes of Rajasthan sent only token forces to aid my raja's defense."
215505 "As my king marched once again to war, I feared that he would not return. I began to write this tale and shared it with the other poets. Even if my king did not survive the battle, his legend would live on throughout all of India."
215506 "I would make sure of it.   "
215551 "Prithviraj's heroism could not overcome his delay. He was defeated and taken to the Turkish warlord's castle in the Afghan mountains. There, my king was cruelly blinded and imprisoned."
215552 "I followed my raja in his captivity. When I came to the Turkish court, I regaled the warlord with the same tales and feats that I have told you. Surely, I persuaded him, a generous warlord would treat such a heroic raja as a companion and vassal, not as a prisoner condemned to a sullen dungeon."
215553 "But Muhammad's heart was cruel and though he brought my raja from his prison, he mocked Prithviraj for his blindness. In ridicule, he threw a bow and a single arrow at my raja's feet and dared him to strike at him."
215554 "Prithviraj drew the bow. Though he could not see, the sound of the Turk's sneering laughter made his aim true. He released the arrow, striking Muhammad Ghori. The guards fell upon Prithviraj and slew him."
215555 "In Ajmer, Sanyogita was stricken with grief. So strong was her love that she could not bear to live another day without her Prithviraj. In honor of her husband, and defiant to the end, she took her life by throwing herself into a fire."
215556 "Thus, my story ends where it began - with a legend born of fire."


// 16-1 - Bukhara

216101 "Seventy-three long years have passed since thousands of nomadic riders flooded the Eastern borders of Persia, defeated the Persian army, and killed the shah himself. The invaders plunged deep into the heartland of the empire. The weakened Persians had no choice but to give in to the outrageous demands of tribute imposed by the White Huns."
216102 "Now, Khosrau, the grandson of the slain shah, is ready to take revenge for the eternal shame cast upon his empire."
216103 "Persian heralds visit the four corners of the empire to gather one of the largest armies this world has ever seen. But even with an army that could fill the space between the Zagros and the Alborz mountain ranges, the White Hunnic horse archers will not be easily beaten."
216104 "Khosrau knows that perhaps the only way to ensure victory is to ally with another nomadic people: the Gokturks. These nomads from lands hardly touched by civilization hate the White Huns as much as the Persians do. They are as tough and hardy as the White Huns, and, most importantly, can strike the Huns from their rear."
216105 "The earth trembles as thousands of Persian horses and elephants travel to battle. Khosrau will soon show the world that the Persian Empire is still a force to be reckoned with..."
216151 "The White Huns were powerful but too disorganized to cope with multiple invasions. When the Persians and their Turkic allies launched a two-pronged attack, the White Huns panicked. The mighty Persian beasts of war and swift, accurate Turkish horse archers crushed the disorientated enemy within eight days."
216152 "After the Persian victory at Bukhara, the White Huns faded into history and the Gokturks and Persians divided the conquered land among themselves. Under Khosrau, Persia once more became a worthy rival of the Byzantine Empire, while the Turks established themselves in the vacuum left by the White Huns."

// 16-2 - Cyprus

216201 "\"Deus lo vult! God wills it!\" This zealous shout resounds throughout Europe as news spreads of a Third Crusade, called by the pope himself. Three of Europe's most renowned rulers have sworn to fight: Frederick Barbarossa of the Holy Roman Empire, Philip Augustus of France, and Richard the Lionheart, King of England."
216202 "While the Emperor Barbarossa marches his army across Europe, the kings of France and England sail to the Holy Land. Richard's journey, however, is as adventurous as one can expect of someone known as the 'Lionheart.'"
216203 "A Mediterranean storm scatters the English fleet and shipwrecks many of Richard's ships on the island of Cyprus. The island's ruler and rebellious Byzantine lord, Isaac Komnenos, has taken the stranded English prisoner. Among the captured is Richard's very own sister."
216204 "Richard is determined to punish Komnenos for this insult, but he also sees opportunity in these unfortunate events. Cyprus is an island of great strategic value. If the English can capture it, Cyprus could be used as a naval base for the crusade and raids on the wealthy Muslim trade ships."
216251 "Richard's combined naval and land operations proved to be successful and Cyprus was swiftly taken by the Crusaders. Isaac was thrown into the dungeons and Richard crowned himself king of the island. Richard then sailed east to resume his crusade."
216252 "Upon his arrival in the Holy Land, however, Richard discovered that he alone remained to lead the Crusade. Barbarossa had drowned crossing an Anatolian river, and Philip Augustus had returned to France with an illness. Despite these setbacks, Richard proved more than capable of the task ahead, matching wits with the famed Saladin."
216253 "Richard is remembered as a brave warrior, a skilled commander, and a righteous king, renowned for his patronage of poetry as well as his martial exploits. He remains the ideal of the romantic, chivalric knight, and an iconic figure in both England and France."

// 16-3 - Dos Pilas

216301 "Hidden in the dense jungle of the Yucatán, the Mayan civilization thrives. Massive stone pyramids carved with images of gods and kings tower above the sea of green vegetation."
216302 "The Yucatan is dominated by two city-states, Tikal and Calakmul. Competing for control of the rich trade routes throughout the peninsula, the two cities have warred with each other for as long as anyone can remember."
216303 "To secure the jade and cacao trade, Tikal founded the city of Dos Pilas. Now, the old king of Tikal sends his youngest son, B'alaj Chan K'awiil, to rule it while his oldest son will rule Tikal itself."
216304 "B'alaj, however, is not happy with his small inheritance. The god of war plants seeds of resentment and hate in him and B'alaj is convinced that he would be a better ruler of Tikal than his brother..."
216351 "After years of conflict the war god's thirst for blood was satisfied. B'alaj, having betrayed his father and brother and sacked the city he held dear, was plagued by guilt."
216352 "Despite his victory, he relinquished his claim on Tikal and instead returned to Dos Pilas, where he spent the remainder of his days."
216353 "Later Tikal was rebuilt and it finally overcame its rival Calakmul. However it never truly recovered from the betrayal of one of its dearest sons and the Mayan civilization steadily declined..."

// 16-4 - Honfoglalas

216401 "Throughout Europe, church bells ring while screams and the smell of burning wood fill the air. Everybody knows of the terror of the Vikings and their feared longships, but those who dwell inland face another horror."
216402 "Magyar horsemen strike deep into the European heartland, raiding, plundering, and killing without distinction. These nomadic pagans come from far to the east where they were driven out from their homelands by their aggressive neighbors."
216403 "Now they have arrived in Europe, and their lightning-quick raids terrify the locals. The rulers of Europe are powerless to stop these swift, mounted marauders."
216404 "Raiding, however successful, cannot sustain the Magyar tribes forever, and they are ready to settle down. Scouts have found a suitable location to the south: large open grasslands, similar to the steppes of the Magyar's ancestral home, lie within the Carpathian Basin."
216405 "Only the Eastern Franks, Moravians, and Bulgarians stand in their way. If the Magyars can defeat them, the tribes will once again have a land to call their own."
216451 "The Magyar horsemen annihilated the Frankish army and utterly destroyed the empire of Great Moravia. After centuries of wandering the steppes, they could finally settle down to create their own kingdom."
216452 "Many, however, rejected the thought of exchanging their bows for plows. Not until Otto the Great, founder of the Holy Roman Empire, defeated them at the Battle of Lechfeld did the Magyar raids finally come to an end. After this defeat, the Magyar nomads adopted European ways, converted to the Christian faith, and transformed into farmers."
216453 "They founded the Kingdom of Hungary, whose army was famed for its combined elements of nomadic horsemen and heavy cavalry. For centuries, Hungary would stand firm as the frontier stronghold of Europe, resisting invaders from the east---invaders much like the first Magyar raiders who ventured into Europe."

// 16-5 - Kurikara

216501 "Gliding through the trees, the wind whispers a faint melody to the rhythm of the footsteps of soldiers. The narrow mountain pass feels ominous and forbidding, and yet there is a peaceful aura to it that calms Minamoto's vanguard."
216502 "The common soldiers groan as a deluge suddenly begins, transforming the soil into a treacherous sea of mud. The battle-hardened samurai alone are silent. Their honor is their prime concern, and it rests on the success of their mission: to deliver supplies to the besieged city of Kurikara."
216503 "After years of injustice, the Minamoto clan declared open opposition to the dominance of the wicked Taira, splitting Japan in two. Lord Minamoto controls the East, while his cousin Yoshinaka holds the frontier. Throughout two and a half years of war, the Taira have steadily advanced, rarely seeing defeat."
216504 "Their armies strike at Kurikara in a three-pronged assault, while an auxiliary force seizes the lighthouse at the point of the Noto Peninsula, controlling naval passage in and out of the Toyama Gulf. Entourages of samurai patrol all roads to Kurikara, and enemy supply lines reach all the way to Kyoto, the imperial capital."
216505 "This will be the decisive battle of this war. If Kurikara falls, the Taira will be free to flood into the Minamoto heartland and claim victory. If Kurikara holds and the Taira are defeated, the tide will turn and Minamoto may even be able to bring the fight to the gates of Kyoto."
216551 "Thunder boomed as spears of lightning pierced the sky. Driven back from the walls of Kurikara, the Taira army retreated in panic as Minamoto claimed victory after victory. Smoke rose from the enemy camps and floated towards Kyoto, an ominous shadow of the doom approaching those inside the city."
216552 "Offering thanks and prayers to the gods, Minamoto halted and made camp outside Kyoto. Siege engines pounded the walls for days, reducing its great castles to piles of rubble. As the main gate fell, samurai poured into the city while Minamoto strode triumphantly to the Imperial Palace and planted his banner."
216553 "With the power of the Taira broken and their capital taken, a seemingly doomed rebellion had triumphed. It would take two more long years, but Minamoto's prowess as a commander ensured victory at the battle of Dan-no-ura, ending the Genpei War and ushering in the new era of the Kamakura Shogunate."

// 16-6 - Langshan

216601 "In the distance, wooden towers as tall as giants take shape in the dense morning fog that hovers over the vast Poyang lake. These wooden islands, each carrying two to three thousand men and horses, are tall enough to scale city walls. Their target is the Ming city of Nanchang."
216602 "The Mongol Yuan dynasty is on the verge of collapse and Chinese warlords are eager to take its place. The Han want to make use of the fighting between their rivals, the Ming and the Wu, to launch a surprise attack on the Ming and seize the Jiangxi region from them."
216603 "The Ming, however, are not prepared to surrender Nanchang so easily, and their army sails north to face the Han. The Ming general Zhu Yuanzhang is outnumbered, but he is determined to thwart the Han ambitions. After all, only one warlord can rule China."
216651 "Although vastly outnumbered by the large Han tower ships, the smaller and more maneuverable Ming vessels were better suited for the shallow water. During the second night of the battle, the Ming launched a surprise attack with fire ships, which devastated many of the Han ships. Thousands of Han soldiers drowned or burned alive."
216652 "The Ming victory secured their position as the strongest faction in China. In time, they conquered the Middle Kingdom, ending a century of Mongol domination. The new dynasty ruled China for nearly three centuries, ushering in a great age of prosperity and stability."

// 16-7 - Sogut

216701 "As the Mongols descend on the Near East, the Turkish sultanate of Rum is on its last legs and will likely soon crumble. Several Turkish chiefs in Anatolia, called beys, are ready to seize the sultan's lands. Their warriors are hardy and fierce, untamed by the niceties of the Rum court. Once the sultanate is theirs, nothing will stop their further expansion west into Byzantine lands."
216702 "The most fierce of the Turkish beys is Osman “the Bone Breaker,” a reputable man who claims to have been given the authority to rule over the world by God himself. He is determined to unite the Turks against their common enemies."
216703 "Facing Osman is the proclaimed savior of the Byzantine Empire: Roger de Flor, a former Knight Templar and commander of the Catalan Company of mercenaries. Years of service fighting for the lords and princes of Europe have made him and his soldiers hardened veterans."
216704 "The future of Europe and the Middle East will be decided by the outcome of the battle between these two great men."
216751 "Roger de Flor proved to be a match for Osman. He managed to defeat Turkish armies on several occasions and almost drove them out of Anatolia."
216752 "Just as de Flor neared his greatest victory, he was betrayed. The jealous Byzantine nobles, fearing that de Flor would take the reconquered lands for himself, ordered his assassination. In retaliation, de Flor's Catalan Company ravaged Byzantine Anatolia and Greece before returning home with the body of their esteemed commander."
216753 "With de Flor finally gone, Osman could complete his conquests and consolidate his power. The other Turkish beys soon acknowledged his rule and he founded his own empire that would bear his name: Osmanli Devleti... the Ottoman Empire."

// 16-8 - York

216801 "Shouts of assent ring around the hall as the sons of Ragnar finish speaking, and ravens fly upwards, eager to bring good tidings to the Aesir. Moments later, the sky flashes with lightning and booms with thunder, signaling the approval of the gods."
216802 "Days later, the mustering begins. Kings, jarls, warriors, and common folk alike gather, eager to seek vengeance on the Northumbrian king Aella for the dishonorable slaying of Ragnar. Ivar, one of Ragnar's sons, has sworn to carve the blood eagle on Aella in retribution."
216803 "It is a sight to behold. Hundreds of longships bear crews of valiant Norsemen and enough supplies to last the army months. The Valkyries look on, for they will soon swell Odin's hall with brave warriors who fall in the coming battles."
216804 "Ragnar's sons approach a small band of warriors with a dangerous but important quest: to scout the British Isles and establish a camp. When the army arrives, it will need a secure base from which to strike out against the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms that dominate the British mainland."
216805 "Thor is pleased, for the seas are benign and the winds favorable, allowing the longships a serene passage across the North Sea. As they near York, the seat of Northumbria, the sound of the sea mingles with the grinding of axes. Skalds eagerly prepare to craft the verses for a saga that will be passed down until the end of time."
216851 "Favored by Odin and Thor, the Vikings watered the ground with the blood of their enemies, seizing vast amounts of plunder and fertile land. The stench of smoke and death filled the air as hapless victims foolishly turned to their altars instead of their swords."
216852 "The haughty Anglo-Saxons met their match at the hands of ruthless Viking warriors eager to earn their place at Odin's table. True to their word, Ragnar's sons carved the blood eagle into the back of the cowardly Aella as a warning to any who might think of opposing them."
216853 "Ragnar's sons settled the land that they had conquered, eventually establishing a state known as the Danelaw. For the next two centuries, Dane and Saxon would live as neighbors, sometimes at war, sometimes in peace, until the Saxon victory over the Norse at Stamford Bridge in 1066 foiled the last Viking invasion of England."


// 17 - Tariq ibn Ziyad

217101 "711 AD, year 89 of the Hegira..."
217102 "I begin my tale as the winds throw the sands up into a spiral, forcing the men and horses to shield their eyes and seek refuge. I cannot help but notice how the camels stand tall, undaunted."
217103 "We are a people of the horse, but we have the resilience of camels as well. Invaders have swept through this land for centuries, and yet we Berbers have remained powerful and strong-willed."
217104 "Despite our strength, we have only rarely ventured outside of our homeland on the path of conquest. That is about to change. A man named Tariq ibn Ziyad has sowed the seeds of ambition among warriors and simple herdsmen alike, and we prepare for war."
217105 "Tariq is not as other men. Once a slave, he rose to become a brilliant general. Strong, charismatic, and tactful, he is also a Berber like us. Thousands of men flock to his banner, and men who formerly shunned the thought of venturing across the sea now eagerly board the ships destined for Iberia."
217106 "With Allah as my witness, I shall truthfully record the events to come, for good or ill."
217151 "Wracked by fear and treachery, the slow Visigoth forces fell easily to our agile horsemen. Thousands lie dead, and yet one cannot help but admire how the Visigoths fought valiantly and honorably to the bitter end. It is a melancholy thing to see their corpses left to the crows and wolves."
217152 "As we entered the city of Cordoba, our men stared in awe at the architecture and riches on display. Now is no time for resting, Tariq tells us. There is much left to be done."

217201 "712 AD, year 90 of the Hegira..."
217202 "Banners billow in the wind and the tips of spears glisten in the sun as hundreds of soldiers ride by. A horn sounds as the front of the column approaches a promontory overlooking a large, glorious city."
217203 "We have reached Toledo, the center of the Visigoth Kingdom. I can hardly believe my eyes at her beauty... a city worthy of a king. Tariq is determined that we capture Toledo quickly, before the neighboring cities have the chance to react."
217204 "The Visigoth heartland will be difficult to subdue. Opposing us, in addition to Toledo, are the cities of Seville, Merida, Talavera, and Guadalajara. Many of these cities date back to a time when the Romans still ruled these lands."
217205 "We are not alone, however. Tariq's former master, Musa ibn Nusayr, has landed in the south with a large army. If we can capture Toledo and hold it until Musa's soldiers arrive, we will crush the Visigoths with a two-pronged attack!"
217251 "The Visigoth cities did not fall easily. These people truly fight like lions!"
217252 "To breach the walls of Toledo, Tariq ordered the construction of two large armored rams with iron heads. These engines are indeed fearsome to behold... the gates of city after city crumbled before their might."
217253 "A cloud of dust could be seen from miles away as Musa's army approached, laden down with the spoils of war after having breached the cities of Seville and Merida. Both armies celebrated their success with much revelry."

217301 "713 AD, year 91 of the Hegira..."
217302 "The meeting between Tariq and Musa was strange to witness. The respect between the two is considerable, but there is an air of competition, of rivalry..."
217303 "The Caliph has ordered that Tariq and Musa return to Damascus, but they refuse to be robbed of their glory. Dividing the army, Tariq strikes north, while Musa targets the city of Zaragoza."
217304 "Recognizing our might, a local Visigoth lord, Theodemir of Murcia, has pledged us his support. Home to a strong army and a thriving economy, Murcia will be a potent ally."
217305 "However, we have a new and dangerous enemy. Pelayo of Asturias, a Visigoth nobleman, has rallied what was a fractured resistance into a formidable adversary. In his dominion in Asturias, a large army gathers, preparing to attack."
217306 "If we can weather the storm that is sure to come, with the blessing of Allah we may even be able to conquer as far as Septimania!"
217351 "Septimania and the Ebro valley have fallen beneath the heel of our glorious armies, but we have not achieved a complete victory. Tariq and Musa were forced to return to Damascus, and without their leadership it will be difficult to defeat the Asturians."
217352 "The future of the conquest looks bleak. I shall continue to chronicle the events ahead, though I fear that our land may fall victim to invasions and internal strife, like so many other kingdoms before us."

217401 "732 AD, year 110 of the Hegira..."
217402 "After many years, our people have finally found another glorious leader to follow. Seeking vengeance for the defeat of our armies at the hands of the Franks over ten years before, Abd ar-Rahman al-Ghafiqi has rallied our armies for another campaign."
217403 "Bred on the battlefield, al-Ghafiqi is no stranger to the ways of war. In addition to successful forays against the Visigoths, Asturians, and Franks, his most recent exploit was the quelling of a rebellion by the Berber governor in Catalonia."
217404 "To reach the land of the Franks, we must make a dangerous crossing of the Pyrenees. To arrive at the other side in time for spring, we will be forced to start this journey in the dead of winter."
217405 "The rugged terrain is difficult for armies to cross, and our enemies will surely seek to hinder our passage. Many men will not survive the journey."
217406 "I grow old, but I will make this journey through the frigid mountains so that I might see another year of conquest."
217451 "Truly, I have not endured such a trying journey in the entirety of my life. The cold and cruel winds were like nothing I have ever experienced, and the fear of enemy ambushes lurking behind every bend is enough to drive a man mad."
217452 "Between the elements and enemy blades, many of our men perished on the crossing. Nevertheless, we arrived in considerable force on the other side. It is more than many hoped for."
217453 "We have little time to rest and recover our strength. The Franks will not lie waiting forever."

217501 "732 AD, year 110 of the Hegira. A month since we crossed the Pyrenees..."
217502 "Our army advances into the heart of Aquitania, scouting the region as we move forward. Thick forests and open fields abound, and we made camp near a river crossing."
217503 "The Frankish army is powerful, but their cavalry cannot match ours as long as we fight on an open field. Using our mobility to our advantage will prove vital in the battles ahead."
217504 "Al-Ghafiqi will risk no error. He has a score to settle with the Frankish count Odo of Aquitaine, the warlord who smashed an Umayyad army at Toulouse ten years ago. After such a long time, these two giants will finally meet again."
217505 "The Frankish lands are divided and are no match for the organization of the Umayyad Caliphate. Capturing the city of Bordeaux will surely throw the region into chaos. Then, we will pounce on the scattered Frankish army like a cat upon a mouse."
217506 "This will be the great razzia, or raid, of our time. I can only pray that we are up to the challenge."
217551 "With the blessing of Allah, the horn announcing our success sings a loud, shrill tone that echoes over the countryside. Upon hearing of our approach, Odo's army descended upon Bordeaux, only to be trampled beneath our hooves."
217552 "Another Frankish army hastened south but was no match for our brave, seasoned warriors. A bloody battle ensued, and afterwards the Franks lamented their defeat, saying that God alone knows the number of the slain."
217553 "With the Frankish army defeated, there is little standing between our magnificent forces and eternal glory as the conquerors of Europe. For centuries, history will remember us as the courageous warriors who defeated countless kings."
217554 "My journey is at an end, but our triumphant army marches north to defeat one final adversary. A man who calls himself \"The Hammer\"--Martel in the Frankish tongue--foolishly believes that he can resist us."
217555 "Soon enough, his feeble army will crumble and flee just like the rest."


// 18 - Sundjata

218101 "You ask me if I know the epic of Sundjata, the great founder of the Mali Empire? Ha ha! You were right not to seek out any ordinary storyteller. For I am Kouyaté, griot of the royal family. Listen well, and I will tell you of this man, Sundjata."
218102 "Sundjata was born to the second wife of the king of the Mandinka people. For the first several years of his life, he could not stand upright. A blacksmith made a sturdy iron rod so that the boy might prop himself up on it, but even that broke beneath him. Then Sundjata found a branch from the sacred baobab tree and miraculously he took his first steps."
218103 "The king's first wife seethed with jealousy, however. She saw no reason for this feeble son of a second wife to take the throne over her own son. When the king died, she exiled Sundjata and his mother."
218104 "They fled to faraway lands, but each kingdom feared the wrath of the Mandinkas and would not take them."
218105 "Only the Mema, far to the south, did not fear the Mandinka. They are a people of proud warriors, and among them Sundjata learned how to hunt and fight. He left his disability behind and became as fierce and strong as a lion! Before long, he was ready to take back his rightful place on the throne."
218106 "When he arrived, however, he found the Mandinka capital in flames ..."
218151 "Sosso warriors from the far north had overrun the capital on the river, slaughtered the new king and all of the royal family, and claimed the land of the Mandinkas for their lord, Sumanguru!"
218152 "Sundjata barely escaped the raiding parties ravaging his homeland. As the only survivor with a claim to the Mandinka throne, Sundjata would never truly be safe. "
218153 "Sundjata knew that he had to bide his time and hide from the Sosso spies until he was strong enough to strike back!"

218201 "Sumanguru was a cruel tyrant and a sorcerer in command of powerful spirits. He was said to possess a magical balophon which would grant him victory if he played it."
218202 "Whether or not Sumanguru had magical powers, he was above all an ambitious conqueror seeking to seize the lands of the old empire of Ghana, a golden kingdom of great wealth and sophistication lost to the desert."
218203 "Sundjata knew that contesting such a man would be difficult. The Sosso had allied with other tribes in the north: the Jolof, the Diafanu, and others who profited immensely from Sosso control over the Saharan trade routes. With such powerful allies and their armies, no one dared to rise up against them."
218204 "Sundjata had one advantage: he was still remembered as the crippled prince of the Mandinkas. As long as this was believed, the Sosso would dismiss him as inconsequential, and he could build his own army."
218205 "To provide proof of his miraculous transformation from crippled boy to strong prince, he took up the baobab branch from his youth and began a journey. From people to people and kingdom to kingdom, he traveled to rally support and prove that he was strong enough to retake his ancestral lands from Sumanguru."
218251 "Sangaran, Labe, Niger, Tabon, and Wagadugu. One by one, the kingdoms of the south and east rallied to Sundjata. But for every king who supported the Mandinka prince, it seemed that Sumanguru conquered three others."
218252 "As successful as Sundjata had been, his coalition could not hope to defeat the Sosso just yet. Sundjata needed a better plan."

218301 "A trader came to Sundjata from beyond the Sahara desert. He had a deep, thick Arabic accent and told of great gold deposits in Sumanguru's lands."
218302 "But Sumanguru did not permit the traders access to this gold. The tyrant gave his allies control over the gold and salt trades, leaving the merchants at their mercy."
218303 "This trade was the flowing blood in the veins of these kingdoms. If the blood stops flowing, the body will wither."
218304 "Sundjata thought about the merchant's words. The next day, he assembled a band of raiders. If trade was the blood of Sumanguru's empire, then Sundjata would drain it just as one drains an animal after a hunt."
218351 "Sundjata raided with unbridled success. With trade diverted into Mandinka lands, allegiance to Sumanguru began to waver across his empire."
218352 "Sundjata put the gold he gained to good use, assuring that his people and allies profited from the new riches. He had proven himself not only an able commander, but also an able king."
218353 "With his newfound successes came greater attention though. Every city in West Africa bellowed the name of Sundjata the Lion, King of the Mandinkas, the King of Mali. Sumanguru could no longer afford to ignore the once-crippled prince. He assembled a vast army for war."

218401 "A beast is most dangerous when cornered. Sumanguru was no different."
218402 "He struck southward into the Mandinka heartland, where he had slaughtered Sundjata's family before. He was rumored to have brought his mystical balophon with him to summon victory, and griots were already singing that the war had been won by the sorcerer before it even began."
218403 "Sundjata met him by the Niger River, at a place called Kirina. A long line of Sosso and Jolof warriors stood tall, banging their shields and grinning at the soldiers of Sundjata's coalition. Horses and camels brought to the field of battle kicked up enough sand to shroud the sun at noon."
218404 "Sumanguru himself took the field in the dusty twilight, and Sundjata faced him from across the hot expanse. As the armies prepared to charge, the music of a balophon began to flow through the air."
218405 "The decisive moment was at hand, and all of West Africa awaited the victor."
218451 "The armies crashed against each other. They buckled and wrenched, bristling serpents coiling and writhing amidst the clamor of weapons and the rumble of hooves. Many times the Malian soldiers faltered, but at critical moments Sundjata would ride across the lines to rally his men, inspiring them to push on and prevail."
218452 "At long last, the Sosso onslaught slowed and their resolve began to fade. Sensing that the tide had turned, Sumanguru abandoned his men and fled into the mountains. At the sight of their leader in flight, the exhausted Sosso lines collapsed."
218453 "The celebrations lasted for days, with the most bountiful feasts ever seen. All the kings of the coalition gathered to proclaim Sundjata their Mansa, the King of Kings. Mali had become an empire, and Sundjata its emperor."

218501 "Mali now dominated the land on both sides of the great Niger River. Mansa Sundjata reigned freely from the gold mines of Bambuk to the city of Gao, but more was needed to stabilize the empire."
218502 "Sumanguru fled to his stronghold of Koumbi Saleh, still wreaking havoc wherever he could. As long as he lived, he would be a threat to the peace of the realm."
218503 "Sundjata called upon his men once again and began a long siege of the mighty Sosso capital and former seat of the Ghana empire. Sundjata would not be denied this final victory."
218551 "With peace in the empire and the deaths of his family avenged, Mansa Sundjata settled well into his role as the ruler of Mali."
218552 "In peace he was as effective an emperor as he was in war, building markets and monuments across his lands. He was a model for all emperors to follow, making his country a center of learning and culture at the edge of the Sahara."
218553 "And so I remain to tell his story. Balafasseke Kouyaté is my name, his humble family historian, a griot of superb bloodline and patronage. And this is Sumanguru's balophon, which I stole before the battle at Kirina, and played that day to inspire the victory of Sundjata!"


// 19 - Francisco de Almeida

219101 "My captain is dead. Tell King Manuel that the red blood of Francisco de Almeida, conqueror of the Indies, stains a white beach at the edge of his empire. After braving Spanish knights, Berber horsemen, and Indian elephants, it was the king's lost faith in a devoted servant that took his life's breath."
219102 "Lies they whispered in our king's ear! They called Dom Francisco mad with lust for power, riches, and glory. Those jackals! Those men who had never set foot on a swaying caravel in a monsoon or felt the heat of the African sun sting upon a reddened neck!"
219103 "Was not my captain's devotion measured in the sweat and blood he poured across three continents and three oceans?"
219104 "I was a boy when the battlefield of Toro birthed the legend of Dom Francisco. While the last of the Moors held in Granada, the Christian kingdoms of Iberia warred for the throne of Castile."
219105 "King Henry had died, leaving his kingdom to his daughter Juana, wife of King Afonso of Portugal. The union of the two lands was celebrated in our country but, for the ambition of a queen, it was not to be..."
219106 "Queen Juana's twenty-five-year-old aunt, Isabella, sought the throne for herself. Her powerful husband, the king of Aragon, led his army into Castile to seize the crown for his wife and unite that kingdom with his own. The armies of Aragon and Portugal met near the city of Toro to decide the fate of three kingdoms..."
219151 "Despite the successes of Dom Francisco and Prince Juan, the Battle of Toro was indecisive. After three more years of war, a compromise was reached."
219152 "Isabella was crowned Queen of Castile, joining that kingdom with Aragon into a unified Spain. In exchange, the wise King Afonso, attuned to the changing times, received Spanish assurances that the African coast and the waters and lands to the East were a Portuguese dominion."

219201 "I began my journey with Dom Francisco two decades ago in Morocco. Thirteen years had passed since the Battle of Toro and the grizzled soldier had risen to be an esteemed counselor to King Juan. Courtly life did not suit my captain well, however. He convinced the king to send him to Africa to fight the Moors."
219202 "King Afonso had conquered the Tangier coast before the war with Aragon but Portugal's hold on Muslim Africa was tenuous. Barbary pirates menaced the coast and Berber tribesmen emerged from the lifeless deserts in fierce raids."
219203 "Against these predators stood a fragile outpost of Christendom on an island in the Loukkos River. The garrison was led by a soldier named Afonso de Albuquerque whose path would cross with ours again in a different world. My captain set sail to take command of this garrison and re-establish Portugal's hold on Tangier."
219204 "It would not be the last time that Dom Francisco carried the flag of Portugal to the dangerous edges of the Christian world."
219251 "While we fought the centuries-old war against the Moors in North Africa, other sons of Portugal were the pioneers of a new age. On small leaky caravels, they took the first daring steps from Europe and lifted the shroud that had obscured our understanding of the wider world for a millennium."
219252 "The world was vast, far vaster than we had ever imagined, but men like Bartolomeu Dias and Vasco da Gama reached distant shores and gave us the first glimmers of a coming global empire."
219253 "The Turks and Moors might flash their scimitars over the Mediterranean, but they wore no armor on their backs. There, in the Indian Ocean, an ancient trade flourished to the enrichment of the Muslim world."
219254 "Armed with cannons and ships built to withstand the storms of the Atlantic, the sons of Portugal would fall upon this world like a famished lion in the fold."

219301 "It was five years ago that I went with Dom Francisco to the Indies. His appointment to the Viceroyship of India by the young King Manuel had shocked the Portuguese court. Dom Francisco was the champion of King Juan, the deceased cousin of the recently crowned king, and the Almeidas had favored a rival claimant to the Portuguese throne."
219302 "The king's intentions were the topic of many hushed whispers."
219303 "We sailed for many months across the edge of the world, preyed upon by pirates, storms, and disease. But as our leaky ships rounded the southern cape of Africa, we saw the first glimmers of the riches of the Orient."
219304 "Three mighty citadels guarded the lucrative trade waters of the Swahili coast where merchants traded ivory, gold, spices, and jewels from the innards of Africa to the fringes of faraway China."
219305 "Weathered by the long voyage, Dom Francisco sought trade and hospitality from the first of these citadels, but her stubborn ruler, a usurper who had slain the rightful sultan, arrogantly closed his gates to us."
219306 "Finding an exiled African prince with ties to a rebel army, my captain cunningly hatched a plan to take the Swahili coast by fire and steel."
219351 "Empires are built on the ruins of dead empires. The pile of burnt stone we left in Mombasa, once a palace, was the foundation for the new Empire of Portugal."
219352 "Our conquest of the Swahili coast sent waves across the Indian Ocean to the wealthy trading cities of Zanzibar, Mogadishu, Calicut, and others. We were met with either fearful gifts or the closed gates of those with the foolishness to challenge our cannons."
219353 "Few would continue to make that mistake."

219401 "After months at sea, we reached our goal: the rich Malabar coast of India, land of a thousand gods, and a haven for spices, gold, and silver. In the brackish lagoons of Kerala, among temples dedicated to strange serpent gods, we established our trading posts in the cities of Cannanore and Cochin."
219402 "From these cities, my captain and his son Lourenco cunningly manipulated the feuding rajas and sultans. They maneuvered through the politics of spice and faith, always with an eye for the most profitable outcome. One Hindu prince, however, defied us."
219403 "This nameless ruler of Calicut, known only by the title 'the Zamorin', threatened to break the carefully crafted deals and rivalries from which Portugal profited. By sword and shrewd tongue, giving no credence to differences of religion or race, he gained allies in the rajas, in the sultans, and in rulers as far away as Egypt and Venice."
219404 "Even our own allies among the Indians fell for his intrigue. The treacherous Kolathiri Raja, prince of Cannanore, betrayed us for the Zamorin's gold. Surrounded by enemies, it seemed that the hands of fate had turned so quickly against us."
219451 "Though the Zamorin limped away from Cannanore bloodied, his resolve was untouched by our cannons."
219452 "In driving men to war, gold can be more powerful than God. For centuries, the wealth of the Indies had passed through the Indian Ocean, carried by Arab, Indian, and Somali merchants to the port cities of Arabia, Egypt, and Africa. From there, endless caravans carried wealth across the desert to Alexandria and then to Istanbul, Venice, and Genoa."
219453 "By rounding Africa, Portuguese traders had upset the traditional balance of this world. With our forts in India, we cut the trade that had enriched the Muslim sultans and the Venetian doge alike. Dom Francisco held a knife to the throats of our enemies and as the lion fed, vultures and jackals appeared."

219501 "We had taken the other side of the world by storm but our old enemies followed."
219502 "As the Zamorin beat his war drums, Ottomans and Egyptians rallied to him. Their ships were carried over the desert and rebuilt by treacherous Venetians. In India, an unlikely Russian renegade called Malik Ayyaz raised the Muslim armies of Gujarat in defense of the Hindu Zamorin. Gold had truly become more powerful than God."
219503 "As this coalition of Hindus, Muslims, and Christians descended on us, liars and jackals flocked to the court of King Manuel. They filled his ears with lies that Dom Francisco had betrayed Portugal and convinced the young king to dispatch an Armada led by Afonso de Albuquerque to relieve my captain of the Viceroyship."
219504 "Dom Francisco, however, was in no mood for politics."
219505 "Tragedy struck off the coast of Chaul. In a heroic naval battle, my captain's beloved son Lourenco was slain by Amir Husain, admiral of the Mamluk fleet of Egypt. Though he deeply loved his son, Dom Francisco did not shed tears for his death. In repayment, my captain vowed to shed blood."
219551 "With his son's death avenged, Dom Francisco surrendered the viceroyship of India and wrote his final chapter. He would not return to his beloved Portugal. Landing in southern Africa to collect water, his party was ambushed by the Khoikhoi natives. We found his body on that forsaken white beach."
219552 "In the five years since we departed Lisbon, we followed Dom Francisco to the edge of the earth. We fought ebony-skinned warriors in the jungles and savannahs of Africa, battled Mamluk sailors on the decks of galleys heaving in the monsoon waves, and struggled against armies of elephants and camels in the sprawling cities of India."
219553 "Our caravels had taken us to the distant shores unknown to our ancestors and awoken Europe to a world beyond our dreams."


// 20 - Yodit

220101 "Aksum - the heart of our empire and the cradle of Ethiopian civilization. Even so, every time our caravan stops here to sell its wares, the city seems less grand: more roofs need thatching, fewer shops are open, and even the shouts of the hawkers are ever so slightly less audible."
220102 "My son doesn't notice, of course. Ever since we entered the city, the boy has stared in awe at every building. It is a marvelous sight for a country lad living in the northern highlands."
220103 "As we passed a church, a set of golden curtains caught his eye. 'Father, have you ever seen such a treasure? Why does nobody guard it - are they not afraid of thieves?' I could not help but smile. 'Why hire strong-arms when even the queen dares not take them?' A deep frown creased my son's brow."
220104 "The boy apparently did not know the story of his ruler yet. 'Forty years ago, when our queen Yodit was but a princess, she discovered the very reason why those curtains do not need any guards...'"
220105 "'Yodit was truly beautiful. Every lord in the empire competed for her hand, much to the displeasure of Gidajan, her nephew and the heir to the throne. Gidajan devised a plan to be rid of her: in the night he stole the golden curtains and hid them in her room.'"
220106 "'When the palace guard discovered the treasure, she was locked in the deepest cells. Luckily, there were some who refused to believe the accusations. One loyal captain named Samuel helped her escape through a secret tunnel.'"
220151 "My son smiled when he heard of Yodit's escape. 'As long as she stayed in the Aksumite Empire, however, Yodit would never be safe from prince Gidajan.'"
220152 "'Her journey had merely begun...'"

220201 "Despite the late hour, the market of Aksum was still crowded. Vendors shouted from several wooden stalls, describing their goods: bolts of silk from the Far East, olibanum incense from Arabia, bracelets made from Egyptian glass, our own Ethiopian ivory ..."
220202 "Tired of browsing the stalls, we sat down on a low wall next to a shop. 'Father', Daniel said. 'Will you please tell me the rest of Yodit's story?' Despite my fatigue, I decided to entertain the boy."
220203 "'Yodit traveled north for many years, searching for someone who could help her seek revenge for the humiliation she had suffered at the hands of Gidajan. Eventually, when making camp near the border of Egypt, the princess heard a rumor that perhaps presented the opportunity she had been awaiting.'"
220204 "'The Syrian prince Zanobis was traveling the region, looking for a suitable bride. But how could she, an exiled princess, convince such a powerful man?'"
220251 "'Of course, Zanobis was impressed by Yodit's achievements. He sought after this famous princess and asked her to marry him'. Daniel responded: 'Queen Yodit is truly a strong woman, Father, but how did she...' I quickly raised my hand to stop him: 'No, son. No more questions now.'"
220252 "'It will soon be dark and we need to return to the inn. A meal will do us both much good. Perhaps I shall tell you about one of her great victories before going to bed.'"

220301 "The trade mission in Aksum was quite successful. I sold all of my grain and bought some casks of wine, olive oil and spices. Those goods would be sure to fetch a good price at home."
220302 "I looked up from the accounts and rubbed my eyes, tired from reading by the light of a single candle. 'Everything alright with the camels?' I said to greet the boy. He nodded. I offered him a cup of tea and responded: 'Let me tell you more about Yodit before we turn in.'"
220303 "'After marrying prince Zanobis, Yodit had to be patient for her vengeance. Her husband had to become king and build a larger army if they ever were to defeat the mighty Aksumite Empire.'"
220304 "'Five years had passed since Zanobis had taken the throne when Yodit learned that the Aksumite king, Dagnajan, was planning a military expedition to the east. If she could send an elite force to ambush and kill Dagnajan, the Aksumite empire would be severely crippled.'"
220351 "'When the news of Dagnajan's death reached the city of Aksum, both of his sons tried to seize the throne for themselves.'"
220352 "'A civil war broke out and the once-mighty empire began to crumble. Of course, Yodit...', a soft snoring drew my attention to my son. The lad was already sleeping."

220401 "Outside the northern gates the camels groaned, irritated by the traders mounting the animals to begin the long journey back to the Ethiopian highlands."
220402 "Drivers urged the large caravan forward with loud shouts and cracking whips. As I took my place next to my boy, the sun slowly began to rise above the hills. Not far from the gate, we passed a field of great stone stelae. Some stood tall, reaching for the sky, but most lay toppled, their pieces scattered over the ground."
220403 "'Father', Daniel asked, looking up at a towering stele, 'when we entered the city you told me that these stones marked the graves of ancient kings. Is Dagnajan buried here as well?' I shook my head. 'No, my son. Those kings are long dead, and the body of Dagnajan was never recovered. His two sons were far too busy trying to slay each other.'"
220404 "'While the Aksumite Empire was divided by civil war, Yodit ordered a fleet to be built. An invading force would cross the Red Sea and strike hard at Massawa, the most important harbor of the empire.'"
220451 "'Although Gidajan had managed to kill his brother and take the throne in the meantime, he had also lost the north to Yodit. Soon, she would advance to the capital for the final battle.'"
220452 "Before I could dispel Daniel's youthful naiveté about warfare, shouts arose from the front of the caravan to stop for the night."

220501 "The caravan had stopped at the top of a hill after a long day of traveling. Some merchants sat around the campfire, sharing wineskins and roasting a goat. Others were already pitching their tents. Up here, the nights could be very cold."
220502 "Daniel had just finished his portion of goat. 'Father, would you finally tell me how Yodit became queen of Aksum?' Before I could respond, Tariku, an old, lean merchant with white hair, stood up. He stared fiercely at my son with his one eye. 'So you want to hear about our good queen, lad?'"
220503 "'Tariku fought against Yodit's troops in Aksum', I whispered to my son. Daniel could only nod to the one-eyed man. 'Thirty years ago', Tariku began solemnly, 'I was patrolling the northern hills of Aksum when suddenly I saw a sea of banners in the distance.'"
220504 "'The sun reflected upon rows of armored men. Yodit had finally arrived to destroy the cradle of Ethiopian civilization! I shivered, for her fury was legendary...'"
220551 "'I saw how Gidajan finally fell, his body covered with blood. He was wrong to kill his brother, yes, but he was the rightful heir to the throne! I tried to defend my homeland from disaster and lost my eye for it. A small price for such an honor.'"
220552 "'Now you remember this well, boy. Yodit's rise to the throne was not some glorious adventure - it was a bloody mess.' The old man leaned back, sighing."
220553 "Glancing at my son, I noticed that he suddenly seemed older than he had this morning. Nobody dared to whisper another word."


// 21 - Gajah Mada

221101 "What drives a king to expand his rule to the very edge of the unknown? Why are his people willing to sacrifice their livelihoods and even their lives for a ruler who sits on an ivory throne?"
221102 "The legends of our ancestors, and the greatness they achieved, drive us forward. All in Asia have heard of the great Srivijaya Empire - a grand power of the past that ruled all of the Indonesian islands. We dream to one day surpass these legends."
221103 "In our culture, we hold the kancil, a tiny mouse deer, the highest among the animals. Foreigners laugh mockingly at our reverence for such a benign creature, but they know nothing of the kancil's heart."
221104 "Despite its unimpressive appearance, the kancil can overcome any obstacle and defeat much larger adversaries through sheer cunning. Its bravery is like that of no other animal."
221105 "Our people are like the kancil. Our enemies underestimate and mock us, but we will show them our true spirit. For that very reason, the story of our empire's founder, Arya Wiraraja, is revered among our people. When faced with a Mongol invasion, he built an empire from a tiny village..."
221151 "I heard the story of Arya Wiraraja many times when I was a child. Through the cunning of the kancil, he defeated both his Javanese overlords and the mighty Mongols."
221152 "Now, Arya did not do this alone. I have always believed that the gods favored him and his descendants."
221153 "That is why I, Gajah Mada, commander of the elite guard of the Majapahit kings, have sworn to serve the royal family until my last breath."

221201 "My longstanding fear that quarrels within the court would threaten its collapse has come to pass. Treacherous warriors draw their karambits at the palace gates as I speak."
221202 "A nobleman called Rakrian Kuti has betrayed the king and now lays siege to the royal palace. Fortunately, his treachery has not spread throughout the empire. The prime minister, Arya Tadah, remains loyal, and we have joined our forces to free the king and crush the rebellion."
221203 "Let us hope that there is still enough time to save our king."
221251 "We crushed the rebellion and executed the leaders. To celebrate our victory, the king threw a great festival, and the poets sang of his courage and ferocity in the face of danger."
221252 "Nevertheless, I am beginning to doubt my king. He believes that he is untouchable and acts immorally, desiring the wives and daughters of his subordinates. Even his most loyal supporters have begun to hate him."
221253 "Tribhuwana, the king's stepsister, has even told me that the king now shows a dubious interest in her."
221254 "With such behavior, it is only a matter of time before something bad will happen to my king."

221301 "As I feared, our king died this afternoon from an unknown illness."
221302 "In his stead, Tribhuwana became queen regent. Her first act as queen was to retire the prime minister and give his position to me."
221303 "Without hesitation, I swore an oath in front of everyone. I would not indulge in any pleasures until I had conquered the entire Indonesian archipelago for the glory of the Majapahit!"
221351 "Even my closest friends doubted me, but I proved my worth. One by one, our mighty armies and majestic fleets conquered the surrounding islands."
221352 "From Bali, the island of the gods, to the old ruins of the Srivijaya Empire... all now answer to the Majapahit Empire, just as I said they would..."

221401 "Time is a cruel mistress as I grow older and older."
221402 "The queen abdicated so that her son, Hayam Wuruk, could take the throne. This does not affect my ambitions. My work is not complete as long as my oath is not fulfilled. Majapahit's navy will go east, towards the small but rich tropical islands of the archipelago."
221403 "They are as many as the stars in the sky, but they too will recognize my authority...and that of Majapahit's rightful king, of course."
221451 "Never before has an empire controlled so much of Indonesia. The Majapahit Empire is truly blessed and its reputation spreads. Emissaries from China and India come to our capital bearing gifts in recognition of our power."
221452 "All that remains is to take the last remaining kingdom on the island of Java. The Sunda kingdom is a thorn in my side and should not be allowed to exist any longer. My king maintains good relations with Sunda, but I am determined to be rid of them! My oath must be fulfilled!"

221501 "While I was watching the dancers in the royal gardens, a plan came to me that will ensure the downfall of the Sunda. An arranged marriage between my king and one of their princesses will cause the Sunda to lower their guard. I will then force them, under threat of destruction, to submit to my king's rule. It is a plot worthy of the cunning kancil!"
221502 "My king has ordered me to go to Bubat Square in our capital to welcome the princess and escort her and her family to our palace. For my plan to succeed, not even the king can know of the plot."
221503 "The Sunda will protest, but with their whole royal family in our city, surrounded by my soldiers, they will have no choice but to submit."
221551 "At first, all went according to my plan. My army surrounded the Sunda royal family and I ordered them to surrender their weapons. I was convinced that they would comply."
221552 "To my surprise, instead of surrendering, the Sunda drew their weapons and attacked my army, even though they were vastly outnumbered. I tried in vain to stop the fighting, but the Sunda were destroyed and my plot crumbled into dust."
221553 "My own king and his family - the family that I have spent my entire life serving - were disgusted by my actions. When the king summoned me, I could see the disappointment and loathing in his eyes. In tears, he told me that his bride-to-be had committed suicide, and that I had ruined the reputation of our empire."
221554 "Many in the Majapahit Empire wanted me dead, but because of my long years of service, the king spared my life. Instead, I was to resign and to withdraw to a small mansion in the countryside. Death would have been a less harsh punishment than having to live with this shame."
221555 "And so, here I am. A lonely old man, once ambitious and young, now trapped in this secluded place. I realize that I was not clever, like the kancil, but rather greedy and blind, like the animals that it misleads. The assassination of the first king, the removal of the prime minister, all of the schemes that I planned and conspired... I let nothing come in the way of my ambitions..."
221556 "...and now I pay the price..."


// 22 - Suryavarman

222101 "Forward march! We do not stop until the sun falls beneath the tree line."
222102 "I am Sangrama, honored general of the Khmer Empire, tasked with quelling a rebellion. Just a year after the passing of the revered Suryavarman, his successor faces staunch opposition. This chaos threatens to dismantle the empire that took nearly five decades to build."
222103 "Inspiring an army of largely levy soldiery is difficult. Most are simple farmers and craftsmen, strangers to the ways of war and the grim chaos of battle. They should understand the cause for which they fight."
222104 "As we trudged through the mud, I summoned the captains to the front of the line. I told them of the events that occurred before many of them were born. They would use this knowledge to inspire their men to fight."
222105 "Suryavarman was once little more than a magnate with a minor claim to the throne held by another. Udayadityavarman I had established his seat in Angkor, claiming the entire empire as his dominion."
222106 "Gathering his army, Suryavarman marched on Angkor from the west, establishing a camp not far from the city."
222151 "The captains listened eagerly as I gave my account of the usurpation. Despite a numerical disadvantage, Suryavarman's tactical acumen proved critical to the success of such a risky offensive. Droves of Udayadityavarman's troops fell to Suryavarman's disciplined infantry and elephant corps."
222152 "Entering Angkor, Suryavarman gave the order to his disciplined army that the city was to be left intact, the civilians unharmed. He would not begin his rule by committing acts of savage tyranny upon his own people."

222201 "Ascent to power does not come easily. Once the head of one beast is removed, three spring to take its place. Thus it was with Suryavarman's enemies."
222202 "Rebel factions sprung up to the north, east, and south of Angkor. Legions of disgruntled soldiers marched on the city, threatening to topple Suryavarman just as quickly as he had ascended to power."
222203 "The most dangerous rebel faction was led by Jayaviravarman, a warlord from Malaysia with a distant claim to the throne. Advancing from the south at a rapid pace, he acquired much support from the local populace."
222204 "Suryavarman had to act quickly. The rebel forces, were they to unite, would present quite a challenge to an army that had only recently emerged victorious from a grueling campaign."
222205 "There was precious little time to spare."
222251 "Humans are interesting creatures. At times they display incredible brilliance, and yet at others they behave like obstinate fools!"
222252 "One can only wonder at the folly that caused the rebel factions to not coordinate their forces. A bundle of sticks is difficult to break, but individual twigs snap with ease."
222253 "Suryavarman's victory assured that his soldiers would not forget this lesson."

222301 "As the empire boomed, its neighbors became wary. They knew that a growing tiger will gorge itself on the prey that it deems most vulnerable."
222302 "Some dreaded the looming war and prayed that their fears were unjustified. Others prepared for it. The Kingdom of Tambralinga, a vassal of the great Srivijayan thalassocracy, felt particularly threatened by Suryavarman's ambition."
222303 "The empire was surrounded by hostile neighbors and conflict was imminent! It seemed that the only thing left to question was who would strike first. Suryavarman was wise enough to know that passivity would only lead to disaster."
222304 "The various Burmese kingdoms to the west of the empire were hostile, but a potential ally lay beyond. The Cholas, a powerful dynasty based in the south of the Indian subcontinent, also desired to bring about the downfall of the Srivijaya."
222305 "Dispatching an envoy laden with gifts could be enough to convince Rajendra Chola that an alliance with Suryavarman would be to his liking."
222351 "Despite the hardships of the journey through hostile territory, the diplomatic convoy arrived in Chola lands largely intact. Rajendra Chola was pleased with the gifts that the envoy lavished upon him."
222352 "Particularly impressive was the grand chariot, a work fashioned by the finest craftsmen in Angkor! Generous offerings and well-chosen words go a long way with a magnanimous ruler."
222353 "A bargain was struck, and the envoy returned to Angkor bearing news of the alliance."

222401 "With the alliance made and the pieces on the board, conflict was inevitable. The Tambralingas themselves posed only a token threat, but they had the support of the immense naval empire of Srivijaya."
222402 "The prowess of the Srivijayan navy was unmatched, but their coalition was at a strategic disadvantage. The Khmer forces threatened the enemy by land from the north and by sea from the east, while the Cholas struck out from the west. The enemy found themselves surrounded on all sides."
222403 "Suryavarman sent word to the Chola force to establish a foothold on the Malay Peninsula. Taking the initiative, he ordered the outfitting of a massive navy to challenge the Srivijayans and Tambralingas for maritime supremacy."
222404 "Everything hinged on the success of the Chola force that had landed on the mainland. If they could present a formidable enough threat and occupy the enemy land forces, Suryavarman would be able to wrest control of the water and launch a devastating amphibious invasion."
222405 "If the Cholas were driven from their foothold, the Khmer would be forced to face down their opponents alone--a prospect that Suryavarman preferred not to contemplate."
222451 "Storms raged as wooden vessels rammed into one another, a deafening sound prefaced by the whistling of projectiles through the air. Thousands of men sank below the angry waves, never to rise again."
222452 "The Chola land force fought bravely, holding to the last. Just as it seemed that they were to be defeated by the Tambralinga-Srivijaya force, salvation arrived in the form of swarms of Khmer."
222453 "Victory has a glorious taste. Over the course of a single conflict, the influence and power of the empire were raised to unprecedented levels."

222501 "With the maritime rivals of the empire crushed, Suryavarman set his sights on the mainland. As the war with the Tambralinga-Srivijaya alliance had progressed, it had not escaped his attention that rivals closer to home had been plotting and wishing for his ruin."
222502 "The rulers of the various Burmese and Cham kingdoms slunk around in the shadows like disgraced cowards. Instead of recognizing the superiority of their larger neighbor, they deviously plotted its downfall and encouraged rebellion within it!"
222503 "This behavior was unacceptable. Suryavarman's enemies may have been too intimidated to face the Khmer juggernaut head-on, but Suryavarman had no reservations about challenging his neighbors."
222504 "It was high time that the empire saw further expansion. The Mekong and Chao Phraya rivers snaked through rich, fertile lands held by decadent, unstable kingdoms ripe for conquest."
222505 "Triumph would add yet another achievement to Suryavarman's legendary military record."
222551 "Hegemony is a wonderful thing. The power and prestige of the Khmer Empire reached new levels under Suryavarman I, and all prospered."
222552 "Despite being known as a great conqueror, Suryavarman was not simply a militaristic aggressor. His reign was marked by vast improvements in the general infrastructure of the empire and an emphasis on religious toleration."
222553 "He erected numerous palaces and temple complexes and ruled benevolently. His legacy lives through these structures, the pride of our citizens, and the strength of the Khmer Empire."
222554 "This legacy is a cause worth defending. It is this notion of greatness that you must invoke to electrify the minds of the common soldiery."


// 23 - Bayinnaung

223101 "1538 AD. Year eight of the reign of King Tabinshwehti."
223102 "Over two decades ago, an old village shaman came to our little mountain kingdom of Toungoo. He claimed to speak with the nats, the ancestral spirits worshiped by our people before the coming of Buddhism."
223103 "The nats had told the shaman that an ancient warrior prince would be reincarnated in our kingdom. This prince would rule as the Cakkavatti, the universal ruler embodying Buddhist virtue. Soon after, the king had a son named Tabinshwehti."
223104 "At the same time, a servant girl also had a son, and she was made the newborn prince's wet nurse. I know this story well, as I am the son of that servant girl and was raised alongside my future king. Thus the nats joined the fates of a king and a servant."
223105 "My mother is not so sure Tabinshwehti is who the nats spoke of. She says the nats are tricky spirits who mislead with their blessings. But I tell my mother I am no prince! Only King Tabinshwehti can lead our small kingdom against our enemies!"
223106 "And our enemies are many. Our lands are under attack by the Shan, a warrior people from the far north. Our walls cannot stop them so we attack south, to gain a stronger foothold in Hanthawaddy."
223107 "The nats bring fear into the heart of the Hanthawaddy king. He flees to his allies just as a frightened buffalo runs to his herd after smelling a tiger. The king and I are the Burmese tigers, chasing after that buffalo!"
223151 "To reward my service in battle, my king bestowed a name of great honor upon me: 'Bayinnaung', which means 'King's Elder Brother'. Though he is a king and I am but the son of a servant girl, he embraced me and declared a shared blood!"
223152 "I am no longer a simple servant. I am Bayinnaung. I am a prince."

223201 "1543 AD. Year thirteen of the reign of King Tabinshwehti."
223202 "Our conquest of Lower Burma has brought fear to the Shan warlords. They call upon their allies, the Kingdom of Ava and the mighty Rakhine people, to raise armies against us."
223203 "My king and I march north to Upper Burma, following the pilgrimage trail to Pagan, city of 10,000 temples. From this city, the ancient kings of Pagan once ruled over a united Burmese people. If my king is to rule all of Burma, he must be crowned in Pagan."
223204 "I will march ahead of my king to secure the ancient city and prepare for the coronation. With my help and the blessings of the nats, my brother will fulfill his prophesied destiny."
223251 "Our kingdom is mighty under King Tabinshwehti. The greatest monks, warriors, and administrators in all of Burma come to our court. The king has made me his chief minister but I worry for my brother."
223252 "A man from distant Portugal has stumbled into the court and intrigued the king with his foreign ways and bottles of strong wine. I fear that the blessed path that we have walked together will come to a cursed end."

223301 "1550 AD. Year twenty of the reign of King Tabinshwehti."
223302 "I am the chief minister of a kingdom without a king."
223303 "The man from Portugal has corrupted King Tabinshwehti. My lord has taken to drinking and forgotten both the ways of Buddhism and the blessings of the nats. He leaves with the foreigner for weeks at a time on long, wine-filled hunting trips. Even when he is in court, the king orders executions in drunken fits!"
223304 "Many of the kingdom's officials have pleaded with me to depose the king and rule Burma justly. But though I love my country, I cannot betray my brother!"
223305 "I should have known rebellion would come. A monk named Htaw, brother of the dead Hanthawaddy king, incites a revolt in the south. The king is leaving on yet another hunting trip but he has ordered me to take the army to defeat this rebel."
223306 "I will follow my king's instructions but I am concerned. A minister named Sawhtut is eager to see me leave. I do not know what trouble he has brewing."
223351 "Sawhtut paid two swordsmen of the king's bodyguard to enter my brother's tent as he slept. Their pockets heavy with the traitor's gold, they drew their swords and beheaded my brother. His body was found by a monk and quietly cremated. I would throw away this crown if it brought my brother back but he is among the nats now."
223352 "The nats were tricky just as my mother told me. They took my brother from me. I should not be king. I should not be the Cakkavatti, but the nats made it so. I reject them."

223401 "1563 AD. Year thirteen of the reign of Bayinnaung, king of Burma."
223402 "The tiger rules the forest but he is always hungry. It is the same with me as I look to the Thai kingdoms of the East. I have ruled for thirteen years but how am I the Cakkavatti if I am only king of Burma?"
223403 "Ayutthaya is the strongest of the Thai kingdoms. Her king, Chakkraphat, has defied me for too long! He encourages the rebellion of one of my vassals, the king of Lan Na. Even now, he sends his daughter to marry the ruler of the kingdom of Lan Xang, in exchange for an alliance against me!"
223404 "But these schemes alone do not drive me to war. I know that Chakkraphat has seven white elephants, a symbol of luck and divine favor. Already, I hear the murmurs in the court. People with more spirit than sense whisper that if I truly am the Cakkavatti, why would the nats have blessed Chakkraphat with the elephants?"
223405 "I cannot allow this Thai king nor the nats themselves to defy me! I will send my armies east but they will not just bring war. I will send Buddhist monks with them to carry the word of my blessed Buddhist rule."
223451 "I have conquered my enemies and made them bow before me. I have purged the land of the nats, building stupas and monasteries where once the spirits ruled."
223452 "I am the Conqueror of the Ten Directions. I am master of all between the foothills of Tibet and the waters of Malacca, between the plains of India and the mountain jungle of Vietnam."
223453 "The kings of Sri Lanka and Portugal send me gifts from across the ocean. The emperors of India and China call me their equal. My life will be written in the legends of three nations for centuries."
223454 "I am Bayinnaung. I am the Cakkavatti."

223501 "1580 AD. Year thirty of the reign of the Cakkavatti."
223502 "Though the tiger grows old, his hunger does not leave him. It grows with age, driving him to fresh hunting grounds and giving him a taste for more dangerous prey!"
223503 "For thirty years, I have ruled Burma and made a dozen kings bow before me. But what will they say of my life? That I ruled by the sword and killed many men? That I, a king, was a slave to my desire? The Old Tiger is stubborn but he knows when his hunger has gotten the best of him."
223504 "My sons lead the army to conquer the Rakhine coast: the gateway to India. They are like their father once, chasing in vain across the earth for their greatest victory..."
223551 "My father did not live to see the conquest of the Rakhine."
223552 "The doctor claimed the lung sickness took his life, but I know my father. No man who rode a charging elephant into throngs of Shan archers, who stormed the cities of the Thai, or who ruled an empire not seen since the ancient days would die from a mere cough!"
223553 "No. My father left this world because he chose to. There was only one conquest left worthy of a man like Bayinnaung."
223554 "I know legends will be told of him. I know old shamans will tell prophesies. But no deed would match his final act. Greater in battle than the man who would conquer a thousand men is he who would conquer just one - himself."


// 24 - Le Loi

224101 "The kingdom of Dai Viet is no more. A storm came from the north and plunged the land into darkness."
224102 "Torn apart by civil war, the kingdom drew the hungry eyes of the Ming emperor. He sent an immense force armed with weapons of fire and smoke to conquer Dai Viet. The Vietnamese people stood no chance against such a menace."
224103 "Foreign soldiers entered the villages and occupied the land. While the Vietnamese aristocracy collaborated and prospered, the common people suffered. The invaders imposed harsh taxes on the people and destroyed many of the holy places. The Vietnamese needed a hero, and that hero was Le Loi."
224104 "Although the son of a nobleman himself, Le Loi despised the aristocracy who had sided with the enemy. When the Chinese came, he fled north to the lands of his family. There, in the hills, he was outside the reach of the Chinese while he organized the resistance."
224105 "Vastly outnumbered by the large Ming army, Le Loi knew he could not defeat them in open battle, and so he turned to guerrilla warfare. He raided Ming camps to steal supplies and gave them to the starving farmers."
224106 "Le Loi's resistance could only succeed through planting the seeds of rebellion in his people."
224151 "The resistance began slowly and with only minor successes, but Le Loi's reputation grew each day. The people started calling him 'The Peacemaking King' and wanted to see him on the throne of the old kingdom."
224152 "The Ming heard rumors of this rebel king and vowed to crush him before his seeds of rebellion could take root."

224201 "Disaster struck the Vietnamese rebels when the Ming defeated them in battle and forced them to retreat to the Chi Linh mountain fortress. Encircled by a large Chinese army and with no hope of help from the outside, Le Loi's situation became grim."
224202 "Supplies would not last long and the Ming cannons had already begun to batter the old walls of the fortress. The end of Le Loi and his rebellion seemed imminent..."
224251 "Just as defeat seemed inevitable, Le Loi's second in command, Le Lai, and his men sacrificed their lives to save what was left of the Vietnamese Rebellion. They mounted their horses and led a final charge right into the Ming besiegers. In the ensuing confusion, Le Loi and the rest of the army escaped through the fortress' drainage system."
224252 "One witness who saw the charge said that he saw the spirits of the Vietnamese ancestors riding along Le Lai and his men as they plunged into the lines of Ming pikes."
224253 "It was a sad day for Le Loi and the Vietnamese. They had lost much and all that remained of the resistance was smoldering ashes and dead bodies."
224254 "However, the tale of Chi Linh spread throughout Vietnam and lit the spark of resistance. The Vietnamese people were no longer willing to tolerate the Ming occupation."

224301 "People from all over Vietnam came to Le Loi - even veterans of old forgotten wars and boys barely old enough to carry weapons. Le Loi needed to use the momentum of the rebellion to deal a decisive blow to the Ming forces."
224302 "The rebel army would strike at the old capital of Hanoi..."
224351 "Hanoi was captured and now all of the southern Ming occupation forces were cut off from China. The Chinese emperor was furious with the failure of his generals."
224352 "Therefore, he sent his most capable general, Wang Tong, to Vietnam. Wang was a veteran of many wars against the nomads of the north and a brilliant tactician. If anyone would be able to challenge Le Loi, it would be him."

224401 "With Hanoi under Le Loi's control, the Chinese retreated behind the walls of the larger towns and cities of the south. There, they would wait for Wang Tong, the approaching Ming general."
224402 "Le Loi had to act quickly, but he could not underestimate the Ming. The garrisons had large stockpiles of gunpowder and Wang Tong's army marched at a frantic pace to reach the besieged cities."
224403 "Le Loi had to quickly turn his peasant rabble into a real army that could face the finest Ming soldiers in open battle."
224451 "After capturing a major citadel with its gunpowder stores intact, Le Loi was able to take several key towns and hold off Wang Tong and his army."
224452 "Wang Tong knew that his position was poor, and so he retreated to strengthen his supply lines and replenish his forces. For now, there would be no battle. Le Loi marched further south with Wang Tong and his army following closely, and gaining strength..."

224501 "Under Le Loi's leadership, the Vietnamese rebellion turned from a rabble of peasants to a real army. Their warships lined up like clouds, their armor shone against the sun, their firearms piled up, and their gunpowder stockpiles were full. Finally, Le Loi would be able to face the full brunt of the Ming forces."
224502 "Wang Tong had been close on Le Loi's tail, watching his every move like a stalking tiger, waiting for Le Loi to make a mistake. Le Loi did not have the luxury of time - every week he waited, more Ming soldiers would arrive. He needed to consolidate his holdings quickly."
224503 "Despite the risk, Le Loi split his troops to deal with the Ming garrisons, the northern army, and the hostile tribes to the west. This was the moment Wang Tong had been waiting for, and the tiger pounced on the divided and vulnerable Vietnamese forces..."
224551 "Against all odds, Le Loi's generals held off the Ming army. The Chinese lost many soldiers and even one of their generals. These losses meant that they would never again hold the advantage in the war. The Ming could only defend their remaining holdings from Le Loi's inevitable victory."
224552 "Without more Chinese troops, not even a general as talented as Wang Tong would be able to stop the Vietnamese army."

224601 "Dong Do was the last fortress in Ming hands. Wang Tong sent for aid, but reinforcements would not be able to reach him easily while Le Loi held the north and the coastlines. Still, Wang Tong's fortress was well-fortified and well-supplied."
224602 "If this fortress could hold out long enough, a new Ming army, now marching from China, would break the Vietnamese army and send Le Loi and his men back into the hills."
224603 "The war was only one battle away from being over, and the fate of Vietnam hung in the balance."
224651 "The Ming were defeated on the battlefield and their last fortress fell. Le Loi and Wang Tong met for the first time and agreed to a truce. It was apparent that the two had great respect for each other."
224652 "The remaining Ming soldiers, numbering more than 80,000, were now at the mercy of the Vietnamese. Le Loi was lenient, however, and spared their lives. He invited the Ming generals to a lavish banquet and allowed all of the Ming soldiers to return to China unharmed. He even provided ships to transport them and released all prisoners that were taken in the war."
224653 "Le Loi knew that the Ming emperor would never give up while his honor was at stake. To make the sure the emperor would not lose face and to secure the future of Vietnam, he sent lavish gifts to the emperor and offered Dai Viet as an independent tributary state of the Ming."
224654 "It was a small price to pay for peace and stability. Le Loi became emperor and his dynasty would reign over an independent Vietnam for centuries. Le Loi would forever be known as the hero of the people of Vietnam."


// 25 - Tamerlane

225101 "The man's eyes surveyed the room as he began to speak. 'A life of flight is a cruel thing. I have seen numerous battles and escaped the clutches of death too many times to count. Thousands of men once followed my call, but I am now without land, army, or title. All that I have left is my quest for vengeance.'"
225102 "Precious time passes as I speak, so I will be blunt: Doom rapidly approaches your land, and you must be ready for it!'"
225103 "The armies of the accursed Tamerlane draw ever nearer, watering the ground with blood. This warlord is the greatest scourge ever seen in all Asia! If you will listen, I will tell you of his conquests, of the terror that he has inspired.'"
225104 "Born into the Barlas, nomads inhabiting the Central Asian steppe, Tamerlane was bred from birth to be a warrior. He spent his youth as a mercenary in the service of the local chieftains, but soon rose to power when his father, a chieftain himself, died.'"
225105 "At this time, Transoxiana was divided between four powers: In the west lay the White Horde and the Blue Horde, mere shadows of the former glory of the Golden Horde. In the east were the two wings of the declining Chagatai Khanate. Tamerlane set his sights on these divided rivals. He was outnumbered, but he had a plan."
225106 "Tokhtamysh, a chieftain challenging his uncle Urus for rule of the White Horde, had sent messengers to Tamerlane seeking his support. If Tamerlane could defeat Urus and install Tokhtamysh in his place, then Tamerlane could rely on the support of a powerful ally."
225151 "As a child, Tamerlane had been dragged into Samarkand in chains by the Mongols. Now, all of Transoxiana was his to command. The leaders of the rival hordes all flocked to him to pledge their loyalty.'"
225152 "The wind roared, whistling through the hall. Flames flickered in the great fires burning within, their distorted shapes resembling the forms of agile warriors. 'The unlucky few that did not submit were destroyed with fire and sword. Towers were built from their bones!'"
225153 "'Tamerlane was now a great amir, or lord, but his thirst for conquest was far from over.'"

225201 "Convinced that my guest knew a great deal about this Tamerlane, I asked him for more insight. I had heard that Tamerlane had been maimed by arrow wounds to his hand and leg. How could his armies accept a lame man as their leader?"
225202 "'A fair question,' he answered. 'It is said that Tamerlane and his fellow tribesmen agreed to decide who would lead them by a footrace. Although Tamerlane's men ran more swiftly, he cast his cap onto the stake marking their goal, and thus won the race.'"
225203 "This man seemed cunning as a fox, a dangerous adversary for any commander. I asked my guest to continue his tale. 'Tamerlane gazed southwest to Persia, a land torn by strife ever since the fall of the Ilkhanate. Persia was vast, its terrain a challenge to any ambitious conqueror. It would not be easy to take.'"
225204 "'Tamerlane, however, could count on the support of his ally Tokhtamysh, who had reunified the Golden Horde. Together, they would ride down the squabbling Persian kingdoms.'"
225251 "'Tokhtamysh's betrayal brought Tamerlane to a rare burst of fury. The man that he had regarded as a son, for whom he had sweated and bled, had stabbed him in the back.'"
225252 "'Tamerlane was forced to halt the Persian campaign to cope with this treachery. Thousands of battle-hardened cavalrymen ceased their pillaging and thundered northwest through the steppe to the lands of the Golden Horde and its allies in Russia.'"
225253 "As if foreshadowing the tale to come, the snow of early spring began to fall outside. Winters lasted a long time in these parts, and even the nobles in the hall, clad in their furs, shivered. 'Tamerlane's vengeance was fearsome to behold,' the man whispered."

225301 "The blasts of wind intensified, snuffing out some of the torches within the hall. Servants bustled about, tending to the meat roasting over the fire. The scent of cooked birds, game, and mutton filled the air."
225302 "This was the first time that Tamerlane's forces had ventured into Europe. The winters were harsh, and Tokhtamysh surely hoped that the biting cold and far-flung supply lines would prove too much for the wily tactician. The armies of the Golden Horde burned crops and took all they could carry as they retreated.'"
225303 "Tokhtamysh knew that Tamerlane would show no mercy. Terrifying reports reached his ears of torched villages and mountains formed from the bones of the slain. Wherever Tamerlane went, it seemed that flock of carrion birds were never far behind. Entire towns surrendered upon hearing of the brutal destruction of one of their neighbors.'"
225304 "'Tokhtamysh had no choice but to engage the rampaging forces of his enemy. The armies met near the banks of the Kondurcha River, sometime during the early weeks of the summer. Crows and vultures circled above the field, an ominous foreshadowing of the carnage to come.'"
225351 "'Raging fires, torrents of blood, piles of ash, the clash of iron, and the screams of the dying. These were the horrors that Tamerlane visited upon the cities and people of the Golden Horde.'"
225352 "The cities of Ryazan, Sarai, Astrakhan, Azov, and Ukek were reduced to rubble. All that remained aside from the ruins were the towers of bones that were built from the corpses of the dead. Those who survived were driven like sheep to march in unspeakable cold.'"
225353 "Tokhtamysh had no choice but to flee west to Lithuania. Tamerlane was determined not to let the traitor escape, but word soon reached him of a rebellion within his homeland. Leaving the hunt in the hands of two of his generals, Tamerlane swiftly returned home to restore order...at the point of a blade.'"

225401 "Listening to the stories of this stranger had stirred our appetites, and we eagerly began to devour our meal. I invited the old man to sit next to me. I still thought that this Tamerlane was more myth than man. Surely he had been beaten in a battle at least once."
225402 "The man has the cunning of a wolf and the composure of an owl. In some battles he strikes hard at the center of the enemy line, while in others swift horsemen outflank the opposition. They then feign a retreat to bait the enemy into a trap - a storm of arrows.'"
225403 "When Tamerlane decided to cross the Khyber Pass into India, a different and terrifying challenge faced him. The armies of the Delhi Sultanate ruled the battlefield through their powerful elephants, monstrous beasts known to crush a horseman with a single foot! Drawing up his lines, the clever warlord waited to spring his latest trap.'"
225451 "The Indian army relied on the charge of its dreaded elephants to shock their enemies and drive them into disorder. No stranger to the art of war, Tamerlane knew this.'"
225452 "In a stroke of genius, he loaded the camels in his baggage train with straw and wood and set them aflame, whipping them towards the enemy lines. The sight terrified the elephants, who doubled back and trampled their own men.'"
225453 "The battle was a rout. Two hundred years' worth of Indian treasure was loaded onto a train of wagons and carried back to Samarkand. In response to an uprising, Tamerlane's armies reduced the jewel of Northern India to a charnel house. Death and fire mingled in a putrid stench that enveloped Delhi for weeks.'"
225454 "Still, Tamerlane was not satisfied--there was unfinished business to the west.'"

225501 "Silence gripped the court as the narrative evoked fear and awe. The meal had been finished for some time, and the fires were beginning to die low. 'If Tamerlane turned west, he surely would have collided with the mighty Ottoman Empire. Would he even dare to do such a thing?'"
225502 "For some time, the local Turkoman tribes of the Levant had been requesting aid against Ottoman aggression. With his army rested and his coffers full of Indian riches, Tamerlane was ready for more bloodshed. He knew that there was more than one way to motivate an army. Religious fervor and promises of land and plunder drove his men forward.'"
225503 "This land was familiar with the terror of previous invasions, but nothing could prepare them for the onslaught that lay ahead. Thirsting for glory, Tamerlane's armies flooded across mountains, plains, and rivers to terrorize Armenia, Georgia, and the Levant.'"
225551 "Tamerlane's forces ran rampant, looting and burning as they went. For a land that had only recently experienced the plague, this scourge must have seemed to signal the end of the world.'"
225552 "Although he was known for his military campaigns, Tamerlane was also a patron of the arts. When a city was sacked, the artisans and scholars were spared and sent to his capital at Samarkand, where they created a vibrant blend of cultures.'"
225553 "'Populations who resisted him, however, were not so lucky. After his siege had broken the Armenian fortress of Van, Tamerlane ordered its inhabitants hurled from the crags.'"
225554 "Just like Hulegu roughly a century before, Tamerlane showed particular cruelty to the city of Baghdad. Each man in Tamerlane's army was required to bring him two heads. The warriors slaughtered the population of the city, then slew the prisoners they had brought with them. It is said that to satisfy Tamerlane's command, some even slew their own wives.'"
225555 "For the survivors of this savagery, it seemed as if the sun would never rise again.'"

225601 "The relationship between Tamerlane and the Ottoman Sultan Bayezid was one of great enmity. The two of them had been exchanging scathing letters for years.'"
225602 "Finally, Tamerlane had the opportunity to crush his rival, whose armies were weary from wars in Byzantium and Hungary. Even so, the Ottoman Empire was no trifling opponent, its army driven by intrepid leadership and the power of its janissaries.'"
225603 "The Ottoman force marching to meet Tamerlane was large but divided. Turks, Serbs, Tatars, and various other vassals all contributed troops to this powerful yet volatile force. If some of them could be pried away and convinced to defect, the tide would turn in Tamerlane's favor.'"
225604 "'This would be his greatest test yet. The fate of two empires hung in the balance!'"
225651 "The Battle of Ankara was a catastrophe for the Ottomans. Never before had they suffered the disgrace of having their sultan captured in battle.'"
225652 "Turning his armies around, Tamerlane left Anatolia in chaos. It is only a matter of time before he seeks another victim.'"
225653 "The man ended his tale on that foreboding note. I realized that I had to prepare my kingdom lest my lands appear ripe for the picking. I ordered everyone to retire to their quarters. We would discuss this new danger in the morning with clear and ready minds."
225654 "Suddenly, the doors burst open and a servant rushed towards me. 'Sire, a messenger from a warlord called Tamerlane is here to speak to you. He claims that you are harboring someone of interest to him.' I turned to the old man, who had not heard the messenger, and asked for his name."
225655 "His weary, dark eyes met mine, and he answered in a grim voice: 'I am Tokhtamysh Khan, of the blood of Genghis Khan and the rightful ruler of the Golden Horde! Landless and friendless, all I have left is my tale.'"


// 26 - Ivaylo

226101 "The day has come for you to know the truth."
226102 "For many years, I avoided your questions, my child - about you, about me, about your father. But you must know. You are not from here. Your homeland is to the north, in Bulgaria. Let me tell you a tale."
226103 "Once, a powerful noble named Konstantin led a rebel army to Tarnovo, the capital of Bulgaria. The reigning tsar, a murderer who had usurped the throne, fled with his son Ivan to the court of the Roman emperor. The grateful nobles of Bulgaria, a class of men called the bolyars, proclaimed Konstantin tsar."
226104 "The new king brought peace to Bulgaria. He wed the emperor's niece and even arranged the marriage of the Roman ruler's daughter to a one-eyed Mongol khan. But such peace was not to last. Men are like wolves; they smell weakness."
226105 "While riding, the tsar fell from his horse, shattering his legs and spine. The crippled tsar watched helplessly as his kingdom descended into anarchy. Tatar raiders invaded his lands, while the bolyars busied themselves with increasing their own power. For fear of the raider's torch, the peasants accepted the bolyar's whip."
226106 "A most unlikely man changed this fate. A common pig farmer appeared in a small village. His hands were calloused and his weathered face was like that of any man who worked for his livelihood."
226107 "But this man was different. Not only did he urge the people to resist the Tatars, but he somehow turned his words into action, leading a militia to defend the villages. Soon, his unlikely successes attracted the attention of far more powerful and ruthless men..."
226151 "Sometimes, the actions of others force us to make drastic decisions. Such was the case with Ivaylo. Whatever his intentions, the armed band he led grew beyond him. It became a force of fury. And of revenge."
226152 "Having overthrown their masters, the peasants took vengeance on the hated nobles, murdering their families before blinding them with scorching hot needles."
226153 "Ivaylo himself was said to have slain Konstantin. The tsar's severed head was carried by a horseman to Tarnovo, the capital. There, it was presented to the tsar's wife, Maria, and their seven-year-old son."

226201 "After her husband's murder, the tsarina ruled a kingdom in disarray. Though this would have challenged even the most capable tsar, the dark-haired Greek princess was greater than most men."
226202 "Beautiful and cunning, Maria Palaiologina Kantakouzene was a daughter of two of the greatest families in Constantinople. She had wed the tsar on the orders of her uncle, the emperor, but her byzantine guile proved as much a benefit to her husband."
226203 "When a rival bolyar threatened Konstantin's rule, Maria offered to adopt him as her son and heir. The opportunistic bolyar accepted and feasted in the tsar's court, only to be found dead shortly afterward. Poisoned."
226204 "But now, with an uprising in the countryside and scheming bolyars in her own court, it would take all of Maria's cunning to preserve her power. But a more threatening menace came from her own uncle..."
226205 "The headstrong Roman Emperor Michael Palaiologos demanded his niece's submission. The tsarina, just as strong-willed, refused."
226206 "Furious that his own niece stifled his ambition, the emperor chose an exiled prince to place on the Bulgarian throne. Ivan, the returning son of the Asen dynasty deposed by Konstantin, led a great Roman army to retake his father's kingdom."
226207 "The tsarina alone could not defeat the Romans. Nor could Ivaylo challenge both the tsarina and Ivan. The logic of these facts dictated a most unlikely alliance: between a rebel leader and the wife of the Tsar he murdered."
226251 "Ivaylo's army filled the Yantra River with Roman dead, securing Maria's place on the throne. Now, the tsarina had to fulfill her end of the bargain. As Ivaylo approached the gates to the fortress, Maria waited silently for the man who had killed her husband."
226252 "As Ivaylo stepped before her, the tsarina placed the tsar's crown, once worn by her husband and father of her child, on the swineherd's head, crowning a peasant a king. The objections of the watching nobility were silent but palpable."
226253 "Then, in a hasty ceremony, Maria wed the newly crowned tsar, tying her fate with his."

226301 "Ivaylo watched suspiciously as the bolyars bowed their heads in his presence. No matter what respect they showed him as tsar in daylight, he knew they whispered and cursed him in the shadows. 'Murderer... Peasant scum...'"
226302 "Tarnovo might be the 'City of the Tsars,' but it belonged to the bolyars. Ivaylo knew that remaining there would be a death sentence, but he was tied to the city - the tsarina was carrying his child. Yet fatherhood would have to wait..."
226303 "The emperor was undeterred by Ivan Asen's defeat. He enlisted his son-in-law, a great Mongol warlord named Nogai, to unleash war on Bulgaria."
226304 "A descendant of Genghis Khan, Nogai was broad shouldered and barrel-chested. He had lost an eye battling a brother in the Caucasus, a disfigurement that cost him the chance to rule as Khan of the Golden Horde."
226305 "However, that was to his liking. Nogai was not a man to sit idly in a golden tent; he became the kingmaker and the real power behind the Horde, leading its warriors into battle."
226306 "Mongols, Tatars, Cumans... warriors as numerous as blades of grass streamed across the Danube into Bulgaria. Ivaylo raced in the middle of the night to the river town of Drastar. There, he would raise an army and make his stand."
226307 "In Tarnovo, the tsarina, alone and with child, waited for his return."
226351 "A lone rider approached Drastar and called for the tsar. Ivaylo wondered, was this a messenger of the one-eyed khan offering peace?"
226352 "But as the tsar raised himself against the battlements, he could see the horseman was a Bulgarian. What word did he bring from Tarnovo? Did he come to tell Ivaylo of the birth of his child?"
226353 "No. The rider bore a message which chilled Ivaylo and the survivors of the siege."
226354 "'Tsar,' the horseman began, 'your men in Tarnovo are dead, murdered by the bolyars who have opened the gates to Ivan Asen. Ivan has taken the tsarina and your newborn child and delivered them as prisoners to the emperor.'"

226401 "Ivaylo rode south, galloping past torched villages and overturned fields. He rode under the tall peaks and through the narrow passages of the Balkan Mountains. There, the remnants of his army would make their final stand."
226402 "A great Roman army was approaching, sent to reinforce Ivan's faction in Tarnovo. The army was commanded by the general Michael Glabas, who had strengthened his already impressive numbers with Tatar mercenaries."
226403 "With Ivan in the north and the Romans marching from the south, Ivaylo knew neither refuge nor retreat remained for his last followers. His men would win or die in these mountain passes."
226404 "But these valleys had witnessed impossible victories before. Here was where Bulgarian khans and tsars etched their places in history. The walls of granite rock echoed the names of heroes like Krum, Simeon, and Kaloyan the Romanslayer. To these, the names of Ivaylo and his men would be added."
226451 "Ivaylo's impossible victory at the Kotel Pass brought fear to Ivan. He abandoned Tarnovo and fled to the emperor's court. The emperor offered no solace to a coward."
226452 "In Tarnovo, no sooner had the bolyars discovered the tsar's throne empty than they began to squabble over it. The wisest of the bolyars reminded the others that the kingdom was still threatened by both Mongols and Romans. Bulgaria needed stability and that would mean all bolyars would need to unite under a single banner."
226453 "From among their ranks, the bolyars found a warrior to defend and unite the kingdom - a man descended from the tribe of the legendary Cuman warrior, Kotyan. They chose Georgi Terter as tsar."

226501 "Betrayed by Georgi Terter, Ivaylo returned to Tarnovo, but the gates were barred to him. His men finally gave up hope. They returned to their fields, their uprising and Ivaylo's brief reign just a memory, to be lost and forgotten."
226502 "But Ivaylo could not forget. As he stood powerless before the city's walls, the weight of his fate as a mere pig herder finally weighed upon him."
226503 "He had defied all odds. He had not just challenged a tsar, a khan, and an emperor, but had upset the very order of the world. He, a swineherd, had dared to overthrow kings and make men free."
226504 "With these thoughts, Ivaylo took the greatest risk of his life. Perhaps blinded by his ambition, or blinded by his hope, Ivaylo turned to his enemy for help. He sought redemption in the land of the blind, where the one-eyed man is king."
226551 "The one-eyed khan ordered a feast for Ivaylo and Ivan Asen, where he listened to their arguments on why he should support one over the other. Then, having heard enough, Nogai rose and pointed to Ivaylo."
226552 "In that moment, it is said that Nogai's guards seized Ivaylo and murdered him. The body was taken away as Nogai returned to his seat and finished his meal."
226553 "But I am not so sure that was the end of our hero. In the years since, Ivaylo has appeared again in many places and many times. Wherever the downtrodden have the courage to fight for freedom and justice, Ivaylo seems to appear. He lives in all of us and especially in you, my child."
226554 "I can see you are confused. I know you are thinking, 'What does this pig herding tsar have to do with me?' Don't you see, my dear? I lived in Bulgaria then. So did you, in fact."
226555 "You were very young, then. A mere baby when I wrapped you in your swaddling clothes and carried you here. It was on the day when the emperor, my uncle, took us from Tarnovo and from your father, Tsar Ivaylo."


// 27 - Kotyan

227101 "Like a swarm of locusts, the Mongol horde emerged from the east, driven by a madman named Genghis Khan."
227102 "When we first heard the rumors of their approach, we thought the Mongols were but mere bands of raiders, not unusual on the steppes. But when spies from the east told us that the Mongols had utterly destroyed the Persian Empire, putting its civilians to the sword and burning its cities to ash in three short years, we realized that we had severely underestimated them."
227103 "Not much later, our own people faced this new scourge. Our Kipchak brethren to the east fought bravely but were easily defeated and several of their khans were captured."
227104 "The Mongols buried the Kipchak khans alive underneath a podium on which the Mongol commander, Subotai Ba'atur, sat to celebrate his victory. The Mongols called it an honorable death, only reserved for nobility and royalty. I believe that these Mongols are evil demons, sent to torture us."
227105 "Only the western part of our once mighty confederation remains, and with it the great Cumania has become a mere shadow of its former self. However, one of the khans, Kotyan, recognizes our peril and is rallying all of the tribes to unite against the invaders."
227106 "Putting aside his pride, he has turned to our sworn enemies, the Rus, and is asking them to join the fight. They may be hostile towards us, but we have no other choice. The Mongols will scourge this earth and enslave everyone on it. Let us hope that the Rus princes come to realize that too, before it is too late."
227151 "The Rus principalities were not easy to persuade. However, when news reached the Rus princes that a large Mongol army was riding west toward the Dnieper River, they accepted Kotyan's offer. Now, a united army of Rus soldiers and Cuman horsemen stand together to face the incoming Mongol horde."
227152 "It is a magnificent sight to behold as our combined armies march to meet the Mongols on the field of battle. Beams of sunlight dance on the shields of Rus foot soldiers, the full body armor of the Boyars and the iron-clad Cuman horsemen."
227153 "If this odd coalition of Rus' and Cumans can stand united, we might have a chance of withstanding this scourge from the east."

227201 "The sky has turned dark with the smoke of burning tar. Through it one can see the bodies of men and horses scattered on the battlefield."
227202 "Despite our large numbers, our armies were swept away from this earth like dust on a field."
227203 "The Mongols knew perfectly how to exploit our weaknesses and divide our forces. The hooves of the charging Mongol horsemen sounded like thunder and their arrows poured down on us like rain. Smoking projectiles fired by Mongol catapults caused confusion among our ranks and blocked our line of sight. We saw Rus' princes charge into the smoke, never to be seen again."
227204 "After nine long days, the combined Rus' and Cuman armies were completely annihilated."
227205 "Morale is at an all-time low for those who survived. We Cumans know that all hope is lost for our ancestral homeland. To escape certain death or slavery, we will retreat beyond the Dnieper River to rally and ride west."
227206 "At least Khan Kotyan survived the battle, which gives us a tiny bit of light in these dark times. His calm presence and confident voice can still give hope to the men."
227251 "When looking into the empty eyes of the men sitting in front of the yurts, it is hard to imagine that these men were once fierce steppe horsemen-warriors who were feared by European kings and Byzantine emperors alike."
227252 "Our khan is devastated by the recent events as well and has not eaten since the battle. Each time Kotyan emerges from his tent, his face appears older and more gaunt."
227253 "Pressured by the Mongol horde, we have no other choice than to keep on moving south. At night, Tatar and Mongol raiding parties ambush Cuman guards who wander too far away from camp. It will be yet another sleepless night for the men."

227301 "Although many of us had given up hope, Khan Kotyan still believed in our survival. The messengers that he had sent west returned with good news. Even though we did not expect much grace from the Europeans that we raided for so many centuries, King Bela IV of Hungary offered our people asylum in his country. For the first time in months, our people rejoiced."
227302 "However, before we leave for Hungary, we must first save our kinsmen trapped by Mongol and Tatar raiders in nearby Wallachia."
227303 "The situation is dire, but news reached us that a fellow khan named Girgen is fighting off the enemy raids, trying to rescue our people. If we can reach him in time and rally the remaining tribes, we might have a chance of saving what is left of the free Cumans."
227351 "Although our people numbered up to 40,000 men, women and children, the Hungarian king welcomed us with open arms. Hungarians and Cumans greeted each other amicably and festivities ensued for days. Our leaders were baptized by the Hungarian priests and many of our people followed their example."
227352 "When the festivities end, we will settle in the Hungarian valleys, set up our yurts there, and send our herds out into the fields. Everything seems to be better now. Still, we should not get too comfortable with the Mongol army converging on the Hungarian border."
227353 "Our horsemen will help the Hungarians defend their lands, but we are not the only ones who have come to their aid. Duke Frederick of Austria, an old rival of King Bela, has come to Hungary with a company of heavy armored German knights. We are suspicious of these strangers, but there is no time for internal squabbling. Not in such dire times."

227401 "Treachery!"
227402 "While attending a lavish feast thrown by an Hungarian lord, Khan Kotyan was murdered in cold blood by Hungarian and German knights! Our people are outraged and are out for blood! The Hungarians think we will scatter without Kotyan's leadership, but they are wrong. They have united us in pursuit of one goal--to avenge the death of our one true khan!"
227403 "Our clan leaders have come together and taken an oath according to the old Cuman traditions: with sword in hand over a dead dog, cut in two, they swear not to dismount their horses until Kotyan's death has been paid back in blood. If our leaders fail to honor their oath, their own clansmen will ensure that they suffer the same fate as the dog that they swore the oath upon."
227404 "That is the way of the Cumans."
227405 "We will act before the combined armies of Frederick and the Hungarian lords arrive. We know that there is a safe haven to the south in Bulgaria. The Bulgarian emperor is of Cuman descent and is ready to provide safe passage for our elderly and young."
227406 "In the meantime, all men and women able to mount a horse will venture out to raid the Hungarian countryside. Our vengeance will be swift and thorough. We will show no mercy. Hungary will burn..."
227451 "We left no stone unturned and spared no living being. Every shack, hovel, and hut was burned to the ground, all livestock killed, and all farms trampled to dust."
227452 "After we had plundered the last village before crossing into Bulgaria, I looked over my shoulder and saw nothing but a nightmarish vision of red and black-as if we had brought hell to the surface of the earth itself."
227453 "The Hungarians will think twice in the future before double-crossing us."

227501 "After we left Hungary weakened and defenseless, the Mongols invaded, defeated King Bela and his army, and devastated the country once more. The kingdom is in such a poor state that refugees say that the church bells in Hungary have been quiet for weeks and wild animals now roam the streets of the cities."
227502 "King Bela fled to Austria where Duke Frederick used King Bela's weak position to extort land and make him swear fealty to the Holy Roman Emperor. Just like us, King Bela fell for the treachery of the Austrian duke and the Hungarian nobles."
227503 "Our people stand at a crossroads. We received a letter from King Bela pleading with us to return to Hungary and help him deal with those who wronged us. Many of our leaders are not convinced and still wish to go to Bulgaria. It is not an easy decision, but it is I who have to make it."
227504 "For I am the new great khan of the Cumans, and they depend on my wisdom. I am no Kotyan, but I will follow in his footsteps and ensure the survival of our people and their legacy, something which he had fought so hard for."
227551 "It has been years since I last saw the lands of my ancestors. Although I still often find myself awash in fond memories of my younger years on the Eurasian steppes, I do not grieve, for it is fate that has led us here. Our people have spread out to all corners of the world, leaving a strong mark on it."
227552 "In Hungary, the daughter of Kotyan married the eldest son of King Bela and many of our people live there in peace now. The Cumans who were enslaved and sold by the Mongols years ago have carved out a new empire in the Middle East. I even heard that these 'Mamluks', as they are now called, have defeated the Mongol army invading Syria, halting their relentless expansion once and for all."
227553 "Much blood has been spilled, but I can see a bright future for the people of former Cumania-one where we, like our ancestors before us, will keep on shaping the records of history."


// 28 - Challenges

228001 "Before you can lead an army into battle, you must first learn the nine principles of the Art of War - written by the famous warrior and philosopher, Sun Tzu."
228002 "His teachings come to us from ancient books, and his infinite wisdom about warfare and military tactics still apply to this day."
228003 "I will guide you and teach you these most important lessons, Commander. Listen very well."
228051 "Excellent! You have mastered every lesson that I had to teach. Remember the words of Sun Tzu and his teachings about the Art of War and you will win many battles."
228052 "Or, in the words of the wise philosopher-warrior:\n\n\n'If you know the enemy and you know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles.'"

228101 "Sun Tzu teaches us not only how to engage our enemies but also how to manage logistics. An army cannot fight without proper supplies. Without food, arrows, and arms, an army cannot stand its ground."
228102 "In the words of Sun Tzu: ‘Bring war material with you from home, but forage in enemy territory. Then the army will have enough food to survive.'"
228103 "Let us see if you understand this advice."

228201 "A good commander must learn to be decisive in war. Hesitation or mistakes can mean the difference between victory and defeat. Just as a soldier practices his spear thrusts, so too must a commander learn to be efficient and repeat tasks until he knows them by heart."
228202 "Sun Tzu says: ‘A clever fighter wins his battles by making no mistakes. Making no mistakes is what establishes the certainty of victory, for it means conquering an enemy that is already defeated.’"
228203 "Few generals make it this far. Let us see if you are one of them."

228301 "As your army grows, so do your responsibilities. Not only must you look after your soldiers, but also after their families. It is of great importance that your people are fed, that your population grows, and that your towns increase in size."
228302 "Sun Tzu says: ‘The command of a large force is the same principle as the command of a few men: it is merely a question of dividing up their numbers.’"
228303 "An army is only as strong as the economy that supports it. A large army requires a large population and a surplus of food, gold, and other resources. Show me that you understand this important lesson."

228401 "Sometimes, you will face an enemy stronger than yourself. Be like a wrestler who is smaller than his opponent. He does not meet his opponent's strength with his own, but instead looks for his enemy's weakness. So too must you learn to strike your enemy where he is vulnerable and cut his supply lines before you can meet strength with strength. Here is the virtue in raiding."
228402 "On this subject, Sun Tzu advises: ‘The impact of your army should be like a grindstone dashed against an egg—this is achieved through the knowledge of weak and strong points.’"
228403 "Be relentless, because the enemy will be relentless as well. Now, show me what you learned."

228501 "You are not the only one who will be raiding. Your opponent will not hesitate to attack you when and where you are weakest. Therefore, you must use your skills to defend your people and train your peasants to defend themselves."
228502 "‘Hence that general is skillful in attack whose opponent does not know what to defend; and he is skillful in defense whose opponent does not know what to attack,’ Sun Tzu wrote."
228503 "Show strength where you are weak. Wherever the enemy attacks, show him that you are ready to repel his soldiers. Be ready and prepared, Commander, because now it is up to you."

228601 "A commander goes to war with the army that he has and must think of how to get the most out of it! Your opponent may seem stronger at first glance, but a sly general does not worry. He studies the enemy and the terrain and knows how to use his soldiers to maximum effect."
228602 "Sun Tzu says: ‘The good fighters of old first put themselves beyond the possibility of defeat, and then waited for an opportunity to defeat the enemy.’"
228603 "Did you understand what this advice should tell you? Good! Then it is time to send your troops into battle -- and do not forget to always keep a level head!"

228701 "The most important thing for an army is discipline. A disciplined army can be vastly outnumbered but still seize victory. A disciplined army can hold their ground, move around the battlefield quickly, and, if necessary, retreat in an orderly fashion."
228702 "When fielding your army, Sun Tzu says: ‘Whether to concentrate or to divide your troops, must be decided by circumstances.’"
228703 "Use fast forces against slow ones, use feigned retreats to lure your enemies into ambushes, and split your army to flank your enemy. This is what Sun Tzu teaches us. Do you understand this lesson? If so, take command of your army and show me that you do."

228801 "Sun Tzu stresses balance, but a commander will not always have his two feet on solid ground! Sometimes, he must set sail to achieve victory. Rivers must be navigated to open new trade routes, and oceans must be crossed to make new discoveries. But what if your opponent also has brought ships to sea?"
228802 "Sun Tzu teaches us: ‘The onrush of a conquering force is like the bursting of pent-up waters into a chasm a thousand fathoms deep.’"
228803 "You are not water-shy, are you? Good! The captains of your fleet are awaiting your orders!"

228901 "You may encounter adversaries that do not have the courage to face you on the field. It can be expected that some of your rivals will prefer to hide behind the walls of their strongholds. Besieging an enemy castle is an art of its own that every able general must master."
228902 "Sun Tzu says: ‘A warlike prince carries out his own secret designs, keeping his antagonists in awe. Then he is able to capture their cities and overthrow their kingdoms.’"
228903 "Now is the time to familiarize yourself with the construction and usage of siege equipment. Will you be able to bring down the walls of your opponent?"
